[name]Nae[line]“Big Sis Mayuri, let’s go there next!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok! Let’s go! Ready, start!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Yay! I win!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aw, I lost! You run so fast, Nae-chan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Both of you, it’s not safe to run when it’s this dark.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“It’s fine. Right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Right?”[%p]
It was getting late, so the cleaning party ended as soon as Nae left.[%p]
It was Mayuri and I who’d gone to get Sergeant Clean’s help, so we were responsible for getting her back to the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
Oddly enough, Maho had said she’d wanted to take a walk and came along with us.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Ok, next we race to that store!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“All right! Mayushii won’t lose this time! Ready, start!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sheesh...”[%p]
Nae was more excited than usual.[%p]
Was it because of all the praise that everyone had showered on Sergeant Clean?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Heheh.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm? Cosa c'è?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No, I’ve just never seen you make that face is all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What face?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t know. Like you’re not nervous. Like you’re relaxed.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’ve always seemed like you were really tense, ever since we first met.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe. I never really realized it.”[%p]
At this time of night, most shops off the main road in Akihabara were starting to close, and there was no one around at all.[%p]
The only ones walking down the alley at this hour were us four.[%p]
I looked up, and I could just barely see the stars past the clear winter sky.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Hiyajo-san. There’s something I need to tell you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“About Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu was—”[%p]
Just as I was about to tell her, I could see Nae run across an intersection.[%p]
—Suddenly a black van with its headlights off leapt out of a side street and almost ran over Nae.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Kyah!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Watch out!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Nae just barely avoided being run over, but she fell butt-first on the ground.[%p]
Mayuri ran over to her.[%p]
I warned you![%p]
I went to run over to Nae—[%p]
And realized that something was wrong.[%p]
The black van’s door opened and three people got out.[%p]
Two were wearing masks and one was wearing a full-face helmet.[%p]
All of them had guns.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Freeze!”[%p]
They were speaking in English.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Wha...?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah...!”[%p]
The time and place were different.[%p]
But this was the same thing I’d seen before.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why...”[%p]
The flashback froze me in place.[%p]
The people with guns ignored Mayuri and Nae.[%p]
They came straight for me and Maho.[%p]
I decided they had to be after one of us.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Run!”[%p]
I forced myself out of the flashback and grabbed Maho’s arm, trying to force her to run.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just run!”[%p]
I pushed her hard.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho had a look of terror and confusion on her face, but she did what I told her and started to run.[%p]
She ran down a narrow alleyway and vanished from sight.[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Don’t move!”[%p]
The attackers seemed to be after Maho, not me.[%p]
They tried to follow her down the alleyway.[%p]
But I quickly threw myself between them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!”[%p]
I heard gunshots echo in the dark alleyway, and Mayuri and Nae screamed.[%p]
Did they shoot?![%p]
The attacker in the full-face helmet had fired a warning shot into the sky, it looked like.[%p]
Firing a gun on a Tokyo street was sure to get the police’s attention! Did they just not care?![%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“...”[%p]
I looked closer and realized that in addition to their black helmet, they were wearing a black motorcycle suit.[%p]
At a glance, I could tell the wearer was a woman.[%p]
A woman...[%p]
The black face mask kept me from seeing her face, but...[%p]
Was it Moeka?[%p]
No, that was impossible.[%p]
She should be at Faris’s right now.[%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“...”[%p]
The woman stood in front of me without a word.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you after Hiyajo-san?”[%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“...”[%p]
If they were after Maho,[%p]
I wasn’t sure if it was a good idea to let her escape or not.[%p]
The woman in the motorcycle suit kept her gaze locked on me at all times as she gave the other two men hand signals.[%p]
They headed for the alleyway that Maho had used, with their guns at the ready.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait!”[%p]
I yelled.[%p]
But I hesitated to do anything more.[%p]
Those bulky guys would catch up with Maho almost immediately.[%p]
But if I resisted, I’d put not only my own life in danger, but Mayuri’s and Nae’s as well.[%p]
—Damn it! Please get away, Maho![%p]
I prayed as I watched the attackers run down the alley.[%p]
[name]Uomo armato[line]“Gwah!”[%p]
Suddenly, one of them came flying back out of the alley.[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“...!”[%p]
The other one was crawling backward with his gaze locked on whatever lurked in alley’s rear. It was as if he’d run into a bear.[%p]
Someone... was in that alley.[%p]
Chi?[%p]
Suzuha?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“So... What the hell is going on here?”[%p]
A large, muscular man appeared from the alleyway.[%p]
It was Tennouji Yuugo.[%p]
Had he come all the way from his shop?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I came to see why Nae was late... So, hurt my daughter, will you? You’re going to regret that!”[%p]
[name]Woman in a riding suit[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Woman in a riding suit[line]“Pull back!”[%p]
I could hear the woman in the motorcycle suit shout from within her helmet.[%p]
She must’ve been using a radio.[%p]
It was the order to retreat. She’d made a fast call. She was probably a professional.[%p]
The van started to pull away with its door still open.[%p]
The driver must’ve still been inside.[%p]
Mayuri and Nae were both still sitting on the ground, but evidently they were ok.[%p]
The woman in the motorcycle suit turned around and tried to escape using another alleyway.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait!”[%p]
I chased after her, but she suddenly spun and hit me with the stock of her gun.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gahh!”[%p]
It was so sudden I didn’t have a chance to dodge, so I took the blow right on my jaw.[%p]
I fell to the ground.[%p]
I couldn’t move.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
I just hope Maho made it away ok...[%p]
That was my only thought before I passed out.[%p]
