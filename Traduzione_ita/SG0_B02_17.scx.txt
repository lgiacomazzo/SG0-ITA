About half the seats at Go Go Curry were full.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was Sunday, but it was also after 2 PM, and so the lunchtime rush was over.[%e]
Suzuha was sitting at the restaurant’s far edge, a baseball cap pulled down over her face.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She was hiding her face with the cap, and carefully watching a couple sitting nearby.[%e]
[name]GO GO CURRY clerk[line]“Here you are. Your [color index="280AA02D1400"]Major Curry[color index="800000"].”[%p]
A cheerful employee put down two giant silver plates—or trays, more accurately—in front of them.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha could see the other customers looking at them and whispering.[%e]
The couple really stood out, after all.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The man was a giant who looked like he ate Major Curry all the time, but the woman was slim, pretty, and looked very kind.[%p]
The combination of huge man and slim woman was as unbalanced as the combination of pretty girl and Major Curry.[%e]
The Major Curry was big. It was huge.[%p]
Suzuha knew from experience.[%e]
The massive silver trays were loaded with rice and curry, and topped with two fried cutlets, fried shrimp, sausage, a boiled egg and a mountain of cabbage.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There was two or three times as much curry as you’d find in a normal dish, and the toppings were just as big.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Even a growing young boy would find it hard to eat them all.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha was irritated.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](Why are you ordering Major Curry on your first date with her, Dad?)[%p]
The “Beauty and the Beast” couple that Suzuha was watching, of course, was Itaru and Yuki.[%p]
[margin top="38"]In the morning they’d gone to see a movie in Yurakucho, then they’d come to Akihabara... and gone straight to Go Go Curry.[%e]
Suzuha had followed them the whole time.[%p]
That’s why she couldn’t believe Itaru’s choice of date spots.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](I don’t mind Go Go Curry at all... In fact, I like it, but...)[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line](This is your first date! There are other places you could have gone.)[%p]
She clutched her spoon tight and gritted her teeth.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha knew next to nothing about Japanese youth culture in 2011, and even she knew it was a bad idea. Who knew what was going through Yuki’s mind—or so Suzuha thought.[%p]
Però...[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Wow, it’s even more amazing than the pictures!”[%p]
Surprisingly, Yuki was ignoring the people around her, and innocently enjoying the huge curry.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um... uh... Amane-shi, if you can’t eat it all, I’ll finish it for you, ok?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Ok, thank you. But I’m actually pretty good at this.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Y-Yeah? That’s a surprise.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Heheheh... I actually would always just come and look at the menu outside. I always wanted to try this.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I’m glad you brought me here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I-I’m glad to hear that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?”[%p]
Suzuha had evidently worried over nothing, but still she realized that Itaru was acting strangely.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Ever since he’d come out of the movie theater, he was walking and talking strangely. Instead of his usual hunched posture, he was forcing himself to stand up straight.[%p]
[margin top="38"]His every movement seemed oddly forced, as if he were a broken robot.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And he’d downed glass after glass of water.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Oh, I’m sorry. May I have some more water, too?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Oh, sure. Sure.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Grazie.”[%p]
Itaru poured water into Yuki’s cup.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha had a bad feeling.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And she was right. Itaru was moving so awkwardly that he almost spilled water on her hand.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Kyah...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“A-A-A-A-A-Are you ok?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um... my hand just got a little wet. Anyway, let’s eat before it gets cold, ok?”[%p]
Yuki quickly wiped down the table with her handkerchief, and grabbed her fork and spoon. There were stars in her eyes.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Ok, let’s eat.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“L-Let’s eat.”[%p]
Yuki seemed to be really enjoying her meal, but Itaru was very formal and quiet.[%p]
He was taking little nibbles out of a piece of fried cutlet, like a squirrel eating a nut.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The whole time, they weren’t saying a word.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](What are you doing, Dad? Mom’s not going to want to be around you if you’re like that!)[%p]
She decided to send him a message on RINE telling him to get his act together, and she’d just taken out her phone when—[%e]
[name]GO GO CURRY clerk[line]“Here’s your Major Curry, with extra roux!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?!”[%p]
A huge plate was laid on the table in front of her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The other customers started murmuring again.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Come to think of it, when she’d followed them into the store, she’d ordered her usual—Major Curry with extra roux—and then forgotten about it.[%e]
Now everybody was going to focus on her![%p]
In a small shop like this, it was suicide.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uh...”[%p]
Just as she expected, her eyes met Yuki’s.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Suzuha-san! I didn’t realize you were here!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, um...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah, what a coincidence seeing you here, Yuki-san, Brother...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You should’ve said something.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, I didn’t even notice you. Really.”[%p]
She realized that she should probably leave, but she couldn’t go without at least taking a bite of the Major Curry in front of her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Her experiences in the war had left her completely unable to waste food.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She felt Yuki and Itaru staring at her as she reluctantly picked up her spoon.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, yeah. You two enjoy yourselves.”[%p]
Her only choice was to finish her extra-large curry as soon as possible. She couldn’t let herself be in the way![%p]
[margin top="38"]But instead, Yuki came over and picked up Suzuha’s plate.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh...?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um, excuse me. Can my friend sit with us?”[%p]
[name]GO GO CURRY clerk[line]“Sure, go ahead.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“He says it’s ok. Let’s all eat together!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait, wait, wait. Why?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Why? Because you ordered Major Curry, too. I think we need to have a race.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hashida-san can be the judge.”[%p]
And before Suzuha could respond, Yuki had moved her plate over to their table.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, wait!”[%p]
She had no choice but to follow, but before she sat down, she whispered in Yuki’s ear.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re on a date, right?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? Oh, yeah. I’m on a date.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“It makes me blush when I say it aloud. Heheh...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Itaru didn’t react at all...[%p]
Even though she was sure he’d overheard that.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um, I’ve never been on a date, so I don’t know how they work, but...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is it normal to have a curry speed-eating contest with another girl in the middle of a date?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hmm... I don’t really know.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But you see it a lot in anime and manga, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“A little sister who doesn’t want to lose her big brother runs up to the girlfriend and says, ‘Let’s have a competition!’”[%p]
For some reason, Yuki seemed incredibly enthused.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha was overwhelmed by her energy.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I-I don’t know anything about that...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is that how it works, Brother?”[%p]
But even when she turned to Itaru for help, he just awkwardly sat there, eating his curry like a robot.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Brother?”[%p]
He awkwardly turned his head to face her. The rest of him stayed completely still.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Did you say something?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What’s wrong? You’re acting weird.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I am not acting weird. I am not acting weird at all.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“???”[%p]
Suzuha glanced back at Yuki.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
And for the first time, Yuki looked concerned.[%e]
In the end, Yuki and Suzuha did have their curry-eating contest, and surprisingly, both of them completely finished their meals.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha won by a very small margin, but the battle was exciting enough that not only the other customers, but the staff as well, were applauding at the end.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But the whole time Itaru kept eating by himself.[%e]
Since this wasn’t even a conversation, let alone a date, she sent Itaru home alone.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Part of her wanted to demand Itaru explain himself right now... but she decided to talk to Yuki instead.[%e]
She’d tried her best to avoid Yuki so far, in order to keep her identity a secret, but it was July now.[%p]
She would be gone from this era very soon.[%p]
[margin top="38"]This might be her last chance to talk to Yuki at all.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Whew...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I’m so glad you were there.”[%p]
Yuki sighed a little after Itaru left.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Maybe I did something to offend him...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hashida-san doesn’t seem to enjoy being around me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You don’t think... he was just nervous?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But he was having fun talking with me before the movie, you know?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But after the movie, he started acting really strange...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Did I do something wrong?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I asked him to take me to the curry place... but since he was acting like that the whole time, I wasn’t really sure what to do.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“And so since you happened to be there, I turned to you for help...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
What had happened inside the theater?[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha hadn’t followed them inside.[%p]
She’d spent about two hours killing time outside.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why do you like my brother?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? HUH?!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I mean, maybe I shouldn’t say this, but he’s not exactly a ladykiller.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“What do you think about your brother?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Me?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Do you like him? Hate him?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You like him, right? I can tell by watching you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well... sure.”[%p]
There were parts of him that she didn’t like.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But of course, she loved her dad.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait, why are we talking about me?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Heheh...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So? What about you?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I... still don’t really know if I like him or not.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I... I see.”[%p]
Not only had Itaru not told Yuki he liked her, this was still their first date. And they hadn’t spoken that much before, either.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She hadn’t even reached the point where she saw him as a member of the opposite sex.[%e]
For almost a year, Suzuha had stayed with him, and she, Mayuri, and Faris had done everything they could to get the two of them together. But there hadn’t been any real progress.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha felt uneasy when she thought about the future.[%e]
Maybe her dad wouldn’t be her dad anymore.[%p]
Maybe her mom wouldn’t be her mom anymore.[%p]
Dad and Mom wouldn’t be together...[%p]
[margin top="38"]She imagined that future.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](I don’t want that...)[%p]
She looked straight into Yuki’s eyes.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m going to be leaving soon.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m moving someplace far away.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“R-Really?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t think I’ll be back.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And I’m worried about Da—I mean, my brother.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So, Yuki-san...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I know this is a weird thing for me to ask—”[%p]
And then she bowed deeply.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Please take care of Hashida Itaru.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?”[%p]
There was no answer from Yuki.[%e]
Suzuha looked up, afraid, and tried to gauge the expression on her face.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
She looked kind of lonely.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And kind of sad.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Io non so cosa voglio fare...”[%p]
Yuki whispered, and then Suzuha—[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, jeez! What are we going to do? Everything’s almost finished! Even though it’s never even started!”[%p]
—As soon she got back to the lab, she yelled at her useless father.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Waah, Suzuha! I’m sorry! The Hashida family is doomed!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Stop sitting there feeling sorry for yourself! This isn’t funny!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Start by explaining why you were acting that way today!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You looked so excited when you left this morning. And Mom said you were normal until halfway through the movie!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“È così...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So what the hell happened?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, you see... listen to this!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know how movie theater seats are cramped, right? So I tried to sit as far to the edge as I could so I wouldn’t get in Amane-shi’s way.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And then I heard this crack, and the seat almost broke.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Cosa?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And then I tried to support myself, so I grabbed the armrest—”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“B-But... But...! It wasn’t the armrest, it was Amane-shi’s um... hand...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Mom didn’t say anything about that...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m telling the truth. It was so soft, it couldn’t have been an armrest. It was a girl’s hand! It had to have been!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I-I see...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But you see, I’ve held a lot of 2D girls’ hands, but never a real girl’s...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And? What happened then?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Amane-shi’s so nice. I guess she didn’t try to shake it off because she didn’t want to hurt me.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But you know how fat I am, right? I sweat a lot! She must have gotten soaked! But she didn’t say a word...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And so I really started to think about that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, I see. That’s why you were acting so weird.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m sure in her mind Amane-shi was going, ‘Get off me, you creepy loser pervert!’”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Mom’s not like that.”[%p]
In fact, from the way she was acting, she probably thought she’d upset him somehow.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The problem was what she’d said.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Io non so cosa voglio fare...”[%p]
What did she mean by that?[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know what Mom’s thinking...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Suzuha, let’s give up on Mom and you can live with me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re not making any sense! How am I even supposed to be born?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uuuhh... But it’s impossible!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“How come you’re not even trying? Even if things look bad, you have to keep going!”[%p]
She grabbed her father by the collar and shook him.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you don’t—”[%p]
She remembered how sad Yuki had looked when they’d said goodbye.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Otherwise, something awful will happen.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sì...”[%p]
Suzuha was starting to wonder about leaving, especially now that she had even more to worry about.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—Maybe I shouldn’t have talked to Yuki after all.[%e]
She realized again how powerless she was, being from the future.[%e]
