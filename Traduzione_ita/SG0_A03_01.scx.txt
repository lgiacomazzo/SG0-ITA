[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Makise Kurisu was looking down at something.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](This is impossible.)[%p]
Kurisu couldn’t be here.[%p]
Because she—[%p]
She was dead.[%p]
Was I seeing things?[%p]
Was my desire to see her making me hallucinate?[%p]
But it seemed far too realistic to be a hallucination.[%p]
Still, it felt that if I spoke a word, she’d disappear...[%p]
I couldn’t say a thing.[%p]
What was she staring at, without even moving a muscle?[%p]
She was so still that I thought she must be a hallucination after all. But then—[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hahh...”[%p]
She finally exhaled a little, and slowly turned around.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah...”[%p]
My throat was dry, and I couldn’t speak.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you were standing there, you should’ve said something! You scared me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Happy New Year’s.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah... Ahhh...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, it’s not often I see you come by anymore.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kuri...su...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s really you, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What the heck kind of way to start off the New Year is that? Are you ok? Did you eat something bad?”[%p]
Even her slightly peeved expression...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Cosa c'è?”[%p]
And the gentle flash you sometimes saw in her eyes...[%p]
And this—[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s wrong? Are you really ok?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kyah!”[%p]
Even her warmth...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“H-Hey! W-W-What are you doing?”[%p]
It wasn’t a hallucination.[%p]
Or an intelligenza artificiale on a screen.[%p]
It was the real Makise Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
The real, live Makise Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe, please... let me go...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry... But let me stay like this just a little bit longer...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you... crying?”[%p]
I realized for the first time[%p]
that my cheeks were wet.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
I felt her soft hands on my back.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t worry... It’s ok now...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s ok. It’s ok...”[%p]
She whispered to me in a soft voice and patted me on the back.[%p]
And wrapped her arms around me.[%p]
Like a kind mother, holding a child.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
I finally calmed myself down.[%p]
She was still there.[%p]
She still existed.[%p]
Now that I’d calmed down, I realized what that meant.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, don’t worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That happens to me too, sometimes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You were thinking about Mayuri, weren’t you?”[%p]
...That’s right. Kurisu was here.[%p]
Which meant this was the linea di universo Alfa.[%p]
The world without Mayuri.[%p]
The world where Mayuri died.[%p]
Some small part of me had wished that this was the world beyond Steins Gate.[%p]
That it was a new future, which someone else had opened for me.[%p]
But of course, that was too good to be true.[%p]
There was no way for me to know what had happened.[%p]
But I must have made my choice.[%p]
To give up on Mayuri.[%p]
There was the future where she was gone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Confronted once more with the reality of Mayuri’s death, my heart felt like it was about to burst.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayu...ri...”[%p]
How had she died?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah... Ahhh...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe?”[%p]
Was she pushed in front of a train?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahh... Hahh... Haaahh...”[%p]
Did they shoot her?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahh... Hahh... Hahh... Hahh...”[%p]
Oppure...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Calm down!”[%p]
Kurisu’s tiny hand wrapped around mine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ok? Come on, deep breaths.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahh...”[%p]
Little by little, my racing heart began to calm down.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s not that. It’s not...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you going to take something? I’ll bring you some water.”[%p]
I rummaged through my pocket and found a small box of pills.[%p]
It was the same anxiety medication that I’d already been taking.[%p]
Even in this world, I was still on the same drugs.[%p]
I looked around the room while Kurisu got me some water from the tap.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe. Why...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why did you come back here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You haven’t come here for a long time, you know? Even Hashida stopped coming...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, too?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
The room was awfully clean, then.[%p]
I took a closer look and saw that there were a few places, like Daru’s PC, that were covered in dust, but the rest seemed to have been regularly cleaned.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... Kurisu... you’ve been coming here?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sometimes. They’d be sad, otherwise.”[%p]
I didn’t have to ask who “they” were.[%p]
Mayuri loved this place.[%p]
She loved the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici.[%p]
She loved the time she spent with all the lab mems here.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you apologizing?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Because...”[%p]
I waited, but no answer ever came.[%p]
What was she apologizing for?[%p]
For talking about Mayuri?[%p]
For making me remember?[%p]
Or... for making me choose?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Cosa c'è?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, nothing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ok...”[%p]
If I said something, she’d answer me right away.[%p]
I could reach out and touch her.[%p]
That alone brought me to the verge of tears.[%p]
If I just stayed here, like this—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
What was I thinking?![%p]
I’d given up on everything and left her to die.[%p]
And still, I was happy to be back here in this linea di universo, with Kurisu.[%p]
As I was sad over losing Mayuri, part of me was thinking I wanted to stay here.[%p]
Even though I didn’t have the right.[%p]
If there was a God in this world, he must be a cruel, twisted being.[%p]
Why was he doing this to me again?[%p]
Was what I’d done that wrong?[%p]
I’d already made my choice once.[%p]
There was no way to save the world.[%p]
There was no way to save Kurisu.[%p]
Però...[%p]
With Kurisu in front of me, I was already starting to waver.[%p]
Should I go back to the linea di universo Beta?[%p]
Should I send the D-Mail?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The D-Mail?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey... what happened to the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio)?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? You destroyed it. Did you forget?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-Yeah... that’s right.”[%p]
The Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio) no longer existed, it seemed.[%p]
Of course it didn’t.[%p]
Its mere existence had made us a target of SERN.[%p]
But without it, I couldn’t leave this linea di universo on my own.[%p]
So even if I did stay here in this linea di universo, it wouldn’t be my responsibility.[%p]
It wasn’t my fault, and it wasn’t something I’d wanted.[%p]
Il che significa—[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sorry, could you go get me something to drink?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Something to drink?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m thirsty, you know. Something warm, if you could.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can make instant coffee, if you want.”[%p]
Wasn’t that what Kurisu had always made me do?[%p]
Two cubes of sugar. No milk.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We’re out of coffee.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok.”[%p]
Yeah, I should go.[%p]
I want to get outside and think things through.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Something sweet, with milk and sugar.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought you didn’t put milk in your coffee.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“On cold days, I always want something sweet and creamy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Roger.”[%p]
I stood up and headed for the door, but turned around halfway.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Cosa c'è?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No...”[%p]
It felt like if I took my eyes off her, she’d disappear... But that was far too embarrassing to say.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hang in there.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not a kid. I can run a simple errand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah, you’re right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Bye.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whew...”[%p]
My whole body relaxed the second I stepped outside of the lab.[%p]
Evidently, meeting the living Kurisu had made me really tense.[%p]
I didn’t know how to talk to her or what to say anymore...[%p]
Even though I’d spoken to [Kurisu] like it was the most normal thing in the world.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I still couldn’t believe it, though.[%p]
Was this really the linea di universo Alfa?[%p]
No, if Kurisu was here, it had to be.[%p]
But then why?[%p]
Who had caused the linea di universo change, and how?[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Aiutami, Okabe...”[%p]
That call from [Kurisu].[%p]
Was that what triggered it, somehow?[%p]
...No, I should stop thinking about it.[%p]
If someone else had caused it somehow, I shouldn’t get involved anymore.[%p]
I didn’t want to.[%p]
I didn’t want to overthrow the structure of the world anymore.[%p]
I just wanted to live in peace...[%p]
In a universe with no le linee di universo or [color index="280AA02D1400"]I campi attrattori[color index="800000"].[%p]
I’d stopped letting the whims of fate rule my life.[%p]
There was nothing left that I could do—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Suddenly, something seemed very wrong.[%p]
Kurisu’s words a moment ago... What had they meant?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hang in there.”[%p]
She couldn’t mean to—[%p]
I turned around and rushed back into the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu... You... that...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmph. Too bad. I guess you found me.”[%p]
She was just where I’d seen her the first time, standing and looking toward the back of the development room.[%p]
In the depths of the darkness,[%p]
in a spot that just a moment ago had been covered by a cloth, I saw an old [color index="280AA02D1400"]microwave[color index="800000"] with its door taken off.[%p]
—The Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio).[%p]
Gadget Futuristico N. 8.[%p]
It was the gadget that had changed my fate—no, the fate of the world.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How... Didn’t I destroy it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes. You did.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is a new one I made. You could call it the PhoneWave Custom.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Or wasn’t the real name a little longer? Maybe it should be the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio) Custom.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The name doesn’t matter. You remade it? Why...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“To send a message to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m going to send a message and change the linea di universo.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No... Maybe it would be better to say ‘fix’ rather than ‘change.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I actually finished this over a month ago.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And since then, I’ve just been standing here, wondering whether or not I should send the message.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I certainly didn’t expect you to come see me, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Tell me, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You just came from another linea di universo, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And it was probably the linea di universo Beta. Am I wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You could tell?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’d never do something like that otherwise.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Something like what?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-Well, the way you... hugged me... you know...”[%p]
It was all so wonderful.[%p]
The way her cheeks reddened in embarrassment as she looked away.[%p]
The way she pursed her lips.[%p]
The way she fiddled with the ends of her hair.[%p]
Everything was just so wonderful.[%p]
I realized it again.[%p]
I was in love with her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And what’s more, someone else caused the linea di universo change. You didn’t do it voluntarily.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Am I right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you know everything, then?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do you realize how much time I’ve spent watching you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh...?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, it’s not like that. I don’t mean like watching you... Well, I mean... I do mean it in that sense, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A-Anyway!”[%p]
She took a deep breath and looked up at me again.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you came from the linea di universo Beta, then you chose that world once before, doesn’t it?”[%p]
She was so far beyond what I could hope to be.[%p]
In those brief moments she’d discovered all that.[%p]
She was right about everything.[%p]
But even so, I couldn’t let her know.[%p]
Admitting that would mean admitting that I’d left her to die.[%p]
There was no way I could do that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
In the end, that was all I said.[%p]
But that was an admission, all the same.[%p]
But instead of looking sad, she...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t apologize, dummy. It was your choice, right? So have confidence in it.”[%p]
She tried to cheer me up.[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
Kurisu was right. I was the one who’d chosen the linea di universo Beta.[%p]
Però—[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And you know, I don’t think you were wrong.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You just got here, so you wouldn’t know, but for the last several months you’ve done nothing but blame yourself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not that you’d ever let me see it.”[%p]
It was the same.[%p]
It was the same as what I’d gone through.[%p]
It was the same as the linea di universo Beta.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But there was nothing I could do.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Because your pain was because of me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’d suffered so much to let me live.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But that ends today.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It has to.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Because if it doesn’t, the guilt is going to keep eating away at you. And in the end, it will crush you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the same...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In the end, no matter which choice I make, I regret it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not being able to save you. Not being able to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t matter whether I’m in the linea di universo Alfa or the linea di universo Beta.”[%p]
So maybe—[%p]
Maybe I should just stay here—[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Get a hold of yourself, Okabe Rintaro!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Snap out of it. This isn’t like you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The Hououin Kyouma-san I love is always more confident.”[%p]
Hououin Kyouma, huh?[%p]
There was a name I hadn’t heard in a long time.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You made the right choice. You chose to save Mayuri. And you weren’t wrong.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I let you...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Listen, what you’re seeing right now is... Hmm... It’s a dream. That’s all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A dream?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s right. You had a dream where you met me. That’s all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well? Doesn’t that make you feel a little better?”[%p]
Kurisu sighed a little and laughed.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We’ve learned so much about how the brain works, but we still don’t understand the mechanisms by which we dream.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The brain organizes and processes memories during sleep. One theory says that dreams are a result of that process.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, this is a dream world being experienced by you in the linea di universo Beta. So you can get your head together, you know?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And if it’s a dream, you have to wake up someday. Am I wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But this isn’t a dream! You’re right...”[%p]
I reached out and touched her cheek.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right here, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Touch sensations are just another of the brain’s functions.”[%p]
She took a quick step back.[%p]
The sensation of her cheek disappeared from my fingers.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You won’t be happy here, anyway. You’ll never be rid of the regret.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And neither will I.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That doesn’t change in the linea di universo Beta, either.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve done nothing but regret that I couldn’t save you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But Mayuri’s happy at least, isn’t she?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri is...”[%p]
She doesn’t know anything.[%p]
Because that’s what I wanted.[%p]
I wanted her to know nothing and be happy.[%p]
For now, that wish was still coming true, but...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You want Mayuri to be happy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So do I. I’m the same way.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Which means that you made the right choice after all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I’d finally met her again, but...[%p]
She was here, alive, right in front of me, but...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, come on!”[%p]
She walked up to me, without even trying to hide her frustration.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop this nonsense already, Okabe Rintaro!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You already reached your conclusion. You can’t stay here. You have to go back.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You have to wake up from the dream.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Because I...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to see you suffer like this anymore.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Come on, this is a waste of time. I’m doing it.”[%p]
She turned away from me.[%p]
I could feel the strength of her will.[%p]
Her resolve.[%p]
I remembered what I’d seen just after I’d come to this linea di universo.[%p]
Kurisu had been just standing there, in front of the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio).[%p]
Thinking back, she’d probably already made her decision.[%p]
Without anyone knowing.[%p]
Without anyone to say goodbye to.[%p]
She’d chosen to go to a world where she would no longer exist.[%p]
It had probably taken her a long time, and a lot of struggle, to come to that decision.[%p]
She’d probably asked herself a thousand times if it was really the right answer.[%p]
If this was what she’d chosen after all that—[%p]
I didn’t have the right to stop her.[%p]
It would be wrong.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe. Before you wake up, promise me something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When you get to the linea di universo Beta, forget about me.”[%p]
That was just the opposite of what she’d said that day.[%p]
That day, the day when I’d chosen the linea di universo Beta, she’d said to me...[%p]
“Don’t forget me.”[%p]
But now she was asking for the opposite.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Forget you? You know I can’t do that.”[%p]
She was always like that.[%p]
She always cared more about others than herself.[%p]
She always sacrificed herself.[%p]
She was asking me this for my sake only.[%p]
She didn’t want to be forgotten.[%p]
She hated being forgotten more than anyone else could.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Remember what I said? This is a dream. Once you wake up from a dream, you forget what happened, right?”[%p]
She was stubborn and bull-headed.[%p]
I would never be able to forget her.[%p]
Però—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I still remember the nightmares I had when I was a little kid.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who are you calling a nightmare?”[%p]
It was all I could do to keep from breaking down.[%p]
But that was probably the same for her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, forget about me. Forget about what happened today, and everything that came before.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s what I want...”[%p]
She turned around stuck out her pinky finger.[%p]
She forced it around mine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s a pinky promise. Lie, and I’ll stab an electrode into your hippocampus. Got it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That doesn’t rhyme at all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shut up.”[%p]
Her hand moved away from mine.[%p]
Her gaze looked away from me.[%p]
It was almost time to say goodbye.[%p]
She was sending a message to the past.[%p]
I knew it was the right thing to do.[%p]
I knew this was what she wanted.[%p]
But still—[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Kurisu[line]“Kurisu!”[linebreak][parallel]“Okabe!”[%p]
Our voices overlapped.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-What is it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-You first.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s nothing. I just wanted to say it out loud.”[%p]
The name of the person I cared for.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-What a coincidence. So did I.”[%p]
The name of the person I loved.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, do you remember when we first met?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course I do. You made a hell of a first impression.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So did you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Really... I never thought things would end up like this.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I never thought that encounter would lead to...”[%p]
Would lead to meeting someone so important to me—[%p]
Not that I’d say it now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“È proprio così.”[%p]
I couldn’t say it, but...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But just so you know, you’re only allowed to remember our meeting right now.”[%p]
Even for a little...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Once the linea di universo goes back, you have to forget.”[%p]
Even just for a second.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know.”[%p]
Just for an instant.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmph. So you’re going to forget me, just like that?”[%p]
If it would last just a little longer—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This was your idea.”[%p]
Her voice.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s true, but it still pisses me off to hear you just say it like it was nothing.”[%p]
The way she moved.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First you want me to forget, then you want me to not forget. Which is it?”[%p]
Her smile.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Heh, it’s a joke. I’m just kidding.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh... it’s a joke?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah. Just a joke.”[%p]
Just a little longer, so that I could remember it all—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
But I was out of time.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Bye.”[%p]
Those words were the sign that the magic was over.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
There were a million things I wanted to say, but I stopped myself. Kurisu smiled, satisfied, and turned back toward the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio).[%p]
She probably already had the message ready.[%p]
The Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio) started to boom and crackle like thunder.[%p]
There was a long, long, countdown.[%p]
The whole time, Kurisu faced away from me.[%p]
And I just watched.[%p]
The noise got louder.[%p]
The countdown continued.[%p]
And then—it was time.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe... It’s time to wake up.”[%p]
Kurisu turned around, with a big smile on her face.[%p]
Her voice was cut off by the roar.[%p]
And then I—[%p]
I woke up from my short dream.[%p]
