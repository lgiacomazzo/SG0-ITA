A full day had passed since the operation began.[%p]
Daru still hadn’t managed to break the lock on that folder.[%p]
Thankfully, they hadn’t detected him yet, but that didn’t mean we were safe.[%p]
While Daru did his work, I finished my own, and then handed the rest off to Maho.[%p]
My actions might have changed the future already, but we still had to do our jobs.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha had her arms crossed, expression stern. She had been that way for a while.[%p]
At a glance, she looked calm, but I could see her tapping her arm with her index finger.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, is there nothing I can do?”[%p]
We were finally ready to stop the Third World War. It had to bother her that there was nothing she could do.[%p]
It had to be stopped as soon as possible, but all she could do now was wait.[%p]
She was frustrated and on edge.[%p]
But that was true of everyone else.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just wait a little longer. Daru and Maho are doing their best.”[%p]
Once Maho completed what I’d asked for, there would be something we could do, too.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m gonna go get us something sweet to eat, nya. Sweets are great when you’re tired, nya.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, then I’ll go, too.”[%p]
Just as the two of them stood up, the development room’s curtain opened.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho flinched a little as everyone stared at her, but she quickly smiled. Then she thought better of it and tried to look more serious.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sheesh... You didn’t have to ask me to do all this at once, did you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry... So... Is it done?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I did what you told me to, I guess.”[%p]
The microwave in the back was connected to a different headset than the one I’d seen last year.[%p]
It was the same one she’d used to take my memories.[%p]
That’s why she’d been able to finish this in such a short time.[%p]
A Time Leap Machine.[%p]
So it was done, then...[%p]
Now, even if I had to time leap from the future, I could go back to 48 hours from now.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And this, too.”[%p]
She offered me a pair of smartphones.[%p]
These gadgets would be our secret weapons in the upcoming battle.[%p]
I had Maho make them, too.[%p]
They used a simple AI to create a pseudo-response algorithm that would deceive our opponents.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wow. I can’t believe you managed to make an AI in such a short time.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You were the one who told me to do it.”[%p]
Her face looked exhausted.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I had the voice software I used for Amadeus, so I was able to build it quicker.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And this isn’t anything as complicated as an AI.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You really think you can fool her with this? It’s [Kurisu] we’re talking about here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We just have to deceive her for a short time. All we need to do is keep their eyes off of Daru’s hacking.”[%p]
The goal was just to keep Stratfo confused.[%p]
We didn’t need to hold a long conversation.[%p]
We’d just hook it up for a short time and end the call shortly afterward.[%p]
It was time to get started.[%p]
But first—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I hit the send button on a message I’d already typed to Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
Once it was done, I turned toward the group.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I will now explain the operation.”[%p]
Suzuha, Mayuri, Faris, Lukako...[%p]
I offered them the phones that I’d just been given by Maho.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to have you pair off.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then I want you to take these phones and move around the city.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It would be best to have the pairs as far apart as possible. One can take the Chuo Line, and the other can take the Yamanote Line.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stay in touch, and use the app on the phones called Amadeus.”[%p]
While Daru was doing his hacking, I’d left Akihabara and tried to contact Amadeus from Tokyo Station.[%p]
And it had worked.[%p]
[Kurisu] had responded.[%p]
I’d cut it off instantly, but I was sure of it.[%p]
The app was still working.[%p]
And this plan was going to use it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What do we do once it’s running?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Amadeus is an AI made from the memories of a girl named Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re going to deceive her.”[%p]
That’s right. Our goal was to deceive [Kurisu].[%p]
When we contacted Amadeus, the enemy would know where we were.[%p]
My plan was to take advantage of that fact.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When you boot up the Amadeus app, it will start another program, too.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What’s the other program, nya?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Can you hit the icon with the S right there?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Um... this, nya?”[%p]
Faris tapped her phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro?[line]“Hello. It’s me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, it’s Okarin’s voice.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Try talking to it.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What’s up, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro?[line]“Nothing, really. I just wanted to talk to you a little.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Wow, it automatically answers, huh?”[%p]
What I’d asked Maho to make was a simple program that detected words and phrases in a conversation and replied with set patterns. You could call it an artificial non-intelligence.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s a bot made by Okarin-san and myself. We call it Salieri.”[%p]
Thanks to the famous movie, Salieri was known as a lesser man with an inferiority complex, but in reality he was a very talented composer.[%p]
It felt a bit rude to the real Salieri to give his name to something like this, but there wasn’t time to worry about that now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Once you activate Amadeus, our bot is set to automatically respond to it.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“In other words, we can make them think that it’s you talking?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Proprio così.”[%p]
Which meant Amadeus would think I was where they were.[%p]
I would’ve liked to have had more terminals, but since Amadeus needed the cell phone to be registered with its systems, there weren’t many I could use.[%p]
All I had were my phone and Maho’s, but for a short time period, it would be enough.[%p]
Of course, Maho’s phone had her own version of Salieri.[%p]
And then there was the message I’d sent to Moeka’s RINE.[%p]
The plan was for her to spread information indicating that Maho and I had Kurisu’s laptop and hard drive.[%p]
Even if they were doing the memory experiments, they still wouldn’t want someone else getting their hands on them.[%p]
Sooner or later they’d pick up on that information, and come after me with everything they had.[%p]
Amadeus was in their hands.[%p]
If Amadeus’s location data told them I was there, they would come looking.[%p]
But we wouldn’t be there at all.[%p]
And then they’d get a call from someplace completely different, and head there...[%p]
The plan was to keep them occupied with that, and keep their eyes off the server hacking.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That is your mission.”[%p]
Everyone nodded.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll say again, you must absolutely not make contact with Amadeus for an extended period of time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And once you hang up, you need to move. If something happens, call me immediately.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You need to do these things no matter what. Got it?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um... What should I do?”[%p]
Kagari raised her hand, hesitantly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They know your face. You should stay here.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But I want to help, too! I don’t want to do nothing while Mamma and everyone else are helping.”[%p]
Well, this was a problem...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Please, Okarin-san. Let me help, too.”[%p]
I understood how she felt.[%p]
But I still couldn’t put her in danger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry, but...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan, Mayushii’s gonna work hard for you, too, so do as Okarin says, ok?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ok. If you say so, Mamma.”[%p]
That seemed to be good enough for her.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, shouldn’t we hide Kagari somewhere until this is all over?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe. But where?”[%p]
If we were going to hide her, it would have to be at Lukako’s house, or Faris’s place...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why not go to my hideout?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hideout? You’ve got a hideout?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ve got a lot of them, thanks to my job. If you want one, it’s yours.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right, then, it’s settled. Are you ok with that, Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah. All right.”[%p]
The issue was that I couldn’t leave Kagari alone.[%p]
[name]Woman’s voice[line]“Um, is there something I could do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh..?”[%p]
I turned around and saw that at some point, Yuki had entered the room.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yuki-san...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hashida-san gave me the key to the lab...”[%p]
She showed us the key in her hand apologetically.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“And last night... I called him and he seemed like he was really busy with something. So I brought him some snacks...”[%p]
She put the key away, and then showed us a bag with the logo of a local cake shop on it.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I don’t know what’s going on, but I was hoping there would be something I could do...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But we can’t get you involved...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, she just has to stay with Kagari. It should be fine.”[%p]
Before, I’d thought that it was maybe Yuki who’d attacked the lab.[%p]
But looking back, that was wrong.[%p]
If she was the woman in the motorcycle suit, there was no need to do something so elaborate.[%p]
She could’ve just used the fact that she was in the same circle as Kagari to invite her somewhere and kidnap her.[%p]
There was no need to take the risk of attacking the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Grazie.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right. Yuki-san, you stay with Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want you staying at Daru’s hideout until this all blows over. He can tell you where to go.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Once things calm down, I’ll tell you what’s going on.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“All right.”[%p]
Yuki nodded.[%p]
Now everything was ready.[%p]
I looked around at everyone in the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok, guys. Now just follow the plan, and—”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wait, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t want to say goodbye to [Kurisu]-san?”[%p]
Goodbye...[%p]
Amadeus was an intelligenza artificiale.[%p]
She was an artificial being. Not Kurisu herself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Say goodbye, ok? So you won’t regret it.”[%p]
Mayuri handed back the phone I’d just given her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hai ragione.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you all give me just a minute?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok...”[%p]
I left Mayuri and Lukako behind and went to Akihabara Bridge.[%p]
If I made contact with Amadeus, she’d know where I was.[%p]
That’s why I’d chosen this place.[%p]
This was the first place I’d let Kurisu see how weak I was, back when everything seemed at its darkest.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
An advertising van passed by, blaring jaunty opera music at a loud volume that clashed horribly with its flashy paint job. I waited for it to get out of earshot before I tapped the Amadeus icon.[%p]
She showed herself immediately.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“It’s been a long time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“È vero.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I thought you’d forgotten me.”[%p]
I hadn’t forgotten.[%p]
I could never forget.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve been... busy.”[%p]
How many goodbyes had I said, now?[%p]
I’d said goodbye to her again and again.[%p]
But I’d never gotten used to it.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“So, what is it today?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There was something I wanted to ask you.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What? You want to know if you can make a time machine again?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“That was a joke. Keep going.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just hypothetically... If you could give up your life to save a friend’s, would you do it?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Um, I’m not sure I understand what you’re getting at.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Answer me, please.”[%p]
She must’ve been able to tell from my words and expression that I was serious, because she took on a serious expression as well.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“That friend’s someone special, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“There are still many things I want to do. Many things I have to do. But...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Even so... If I could make that friend, and the people around me, happy... Maybe I would.”[%p]
Kurisu...[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Sorry. I’ve never had that happen to me, so all I can do is imagine. Which means I can’t give you a real answer, but...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“If there was still one person who would remember me... If there was still one person who wouldn’t forget...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, forget about me. Forget about what happened today, and everything that came before.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s what I want...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t forget...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Never.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I will never forget.”[%p]
This was a vow.[%p]
A vow to get me through the long time to come.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Okabe...san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry for asking something so silly.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“No... I don’t mind. Did something happen?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. It’s nothing. Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, bye.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Wait!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh...?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Oh, no... It just felt like I was never going to see you again.”[%p]
Kurisu...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Questo non è vero.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Of course, right? I don’t know where I got that idea...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...We’ll see each other again. I promise.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
That’s right. This wasn’t goodbye forever.[%p]
I’d see her again...[%p]
So I won’t say goodbye.[%p]
Not until I see you again—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“See you again.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Yeah. See you again.”[%p]
Kurisu...[%p]
I’ve got no idea how long it will take.[%p]
But I’m going to reach you.[%p]
I promise.[%p]
I went back to Mayuri and Lukako, and gave them the phone.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you say your goodbyes?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m counting on you guys.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Certo!”[%p]
I watched them disappear into the crowded station and went back to the lab.[%p]
That van was still playing its loud music as it drove down the street.[%p]
Five hours had passed since the operation had begun.[%p]
The only sound in the room was of Daru’s fingers on the keys.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How’s it going, Daru?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It doesn’t look like they’ve found us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it going to take a lot more time?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm... At least 3 hours.”[%p]
I guess it wasn’t going to be easy after all.[%p]
Daru must’ve been exhausted, but he was still working.[%p]
Mayuri and the others were sending me regular messages.[%p]
Mayuri had paired off with Lukako, and Faris with Suzuha. Since they knew each other so well, they were doing a great job of working together and running around Tokyo.[%p]
Suzuha had told me that she’d seen shady-looking people several times, and Moeka had sent me a message saying that they’d “abboccato all’amo.”[%p]
For now, the operation was succeeding without anyone getting hurt.[%p]
But I didn’t expect it to last forever.[%p]
I wanted to get Kurisu’s memory data deleted as fast as possible, but in the end, my only choice was to rely on Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry about this, Daru.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You promised not to say that, buddy.”[%p]
I remembered how he looked 25 years in the future.[%p]
Even in that far-distant future, he was still my friend.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okarin-san... Can I have a second?”[%p]
Until a little bit ago, Maho had been resting to recover from her exhaustion. But at some point she must’ve gotten up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm? Cosa c'è?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Look at this...”[%p]
She handed me a stack of papers.[%p]
It was a printout of Stratfo’s report.[%p]
She must’ve been looking at it after she’d woken up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Che cos'è?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A list of Stratfo’s experimental test subjects.”[%p]
There were rows of names, sexes, and ages, and other information.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Look here.”[%p]
She pointed her small finger at one of the names.[%p]
It said...[%p]
Shiina Kagari.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shiina Kagari?!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“She was one of Stratfo’s guinea pigs.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Of course, I’d known it was a possibility.[%p]
That’s why they’d been looking for her.[%p]
And she had Kurisu’s memories, too...[%p]
But still, it was one thing to suspect it, and another to see proof.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But they never made it to the last phase of the experiments, it looks like. It says she ran away just before they got the chance.”[%p]
That made me feel a lot better.[%p]
If Kagari still had Kurisu’s memories, I would’ve seen a repeat of what happened in the last linea di universo.[%p]
This must be another effect of the linea di universo change.[%p]
But there was still no doubt that she had been in Stratfo’s hands for years.[%p]
And she’d been the subject of many experiments during that time...[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m a little worried.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Maho must’ve been thinking the same thing I was.[%p]
Kagari was alone with Yuki at Daru’s hideout right now.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm? Who’s calling me now? I’m busy!”[%p]
The ringing that suddenly interrupted our conversation was coming from Daru’s phone.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm? It’s Amane-shi. I wonder what’s up.”[%p]
I had a bad feeling.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yes, hello? Amane-shi, what is it? Did something happen?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Kagari-tan was what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened to Kagari?!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She says she’s gone...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Che cosa?!”[%p]
I grabbed the phone out of his hands and put it up to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me, Okabe! Is Kagari really gone?!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Okabe-san! I’m sorry! I was right next to her!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened?! Did she get kidnapped?!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“No... Kagari-san left on her own. I tried my best to stop her, but she was so strong...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“On her own?”[%p]
Cosa sta succedendo?[%p]
Was Yuki really...[%p]
No, that was impossible.[%p]
If Yuki was working for Stratfo, she wouldn’t be calling me.[%p]
But then why had Kagari run off on her own?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Can you put it on speaker? I want to hear this, too.”[%p]
I hit the button to switch the call to speaker phone.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yuki-san, tell me more about what happened before Kagari-san ran off. Was there anything strange?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“No... We were just talking...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Did you see or hear anything strange?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“No... Oh, wait. Come to think of it, I did hear some weird music from outside. It was like some kind of jingle from an advertising van. I remember it because it was really loud...”[%p]
An advertising van?[%p]
Was it the one I’d seen this afternoon?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I just read about it in that file. It was one of the experiments Stratfo did.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The experiment involved lavaggio del cervello.”[%p]
Lavaggio del cervello...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“[color index="280AA02D1400"]Lavaggio del cervello[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I think she might have been brainwashed to behave in a certain manner if she heard a preprogrammed source of music.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s the only way to explain why she’d run off on her own right now.”[%p]
That song the van was playing—[%p]
It was K620-5.[%p]
Il Flauto Magico, sent to lead Kagari astray![%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The file also said that she was an ideal candidate for the experiments and that they were still looking for her...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn it!”[%p]
They probably had vans like that all over Japan, not just Akihabara.[%p]
And she’d fallen right into their trap.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What do we do, Okarin?”[%p]
It was obviously Stratfo that had gone after Kagari.[%p]
Which meant that all we could do was—[%p]
And then there was another call.[%p]
This time it was to my phone.[%p]
I had Faris prepare several cellphones for my use in this operation.[%p]
One to use to call everyone. One to give to Kagari.[%p]
E—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
The call was coming from the phone I’d given to Kagari.[%p]
It probably wasn’t from her, though...[%p]
Who could it be?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]???[line]“Okabe Rintaro, correct?”[%p]
The digitally altered voice made the caller seem even more eerie.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, that’s right. Who are you?”[%p]
[name]???[line]“We have Shiina Kagari. I don’t need to tell you what we want, do I?”[%p]
Kurisu’s laptop and hard drive.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Give me time to think.”[%p]
[name]???[line]“Think? Think about what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]???[line]“The exchange will take place tomorrow. We’ll tell you where and how later.”[%p]
They hung up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They want to swap her for Kurisu’s computer and hard drive.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So, what’s the plan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I can’t believe Kagari was brainwashed...”[%p]
Suzuha was gritting her teeth in frustration as she listened to us.[%p]
I’d had her come back immediately after the call.[%p]
And I’d brought Kiryu Moeka to the lab as well.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want your honest opinion. If we do what they want, will they give us back Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No.”[%p]
Moeka gave her honest opinion.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I agree. They’re willing to use dirty tricks like lavaggio del cervello. If they don’t need her, they’ll just kill her.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“They might kill you, too.”[%p]
The only reason they would’ve called me specifically is that they knew I had information they wanted to keep hidden.[%p]
After what I’d gone through already, I could safely assume they’d show no mercy.[%p]
And they were after what Kurisu had left behind.[%p]
Her memories and her belongings... I didn’t want them causing any more wars.[%p]
Which meant there was only one thing I could do.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll have to bust in and take back Kagari.”[%p]
It was dangerous, but it was the only way.[%p]
Mayuri and the others were still out there fighting.[%p]
Which meant they should still think I was running around the city.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Bust in...? You don’t even know where they are!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I do.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Really? Uncle, when did you—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha, will you help?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
I turned toward Moeka, who shook her head.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m not willing to go that far...”[%p]
I bet.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You can’t go alone. It’s too dangerous.”[%p]

[name]Itaru[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, here.”[%p]
Suzuha handed me a semiautomatic pistol.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“A [color index="280AA02D1400"]Glock[color index="800000"]...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Protect yourself, if you have to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I hesitated, but decided to take it.[%p]
It was the first time in my life I’d ever held a gun, and it was a lot heavier than I expected it to be.[%p]
