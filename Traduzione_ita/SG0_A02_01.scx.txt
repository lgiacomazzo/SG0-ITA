[name]Kana[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well? Calm down a bit?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Yes... Thank you.”[%p]
Kana had passed out after hearing the name “Shiina Kagari” from Suzuha, but with help from Lukako and the girls, she woke up ten minutes later.[%p]
But she still didn’t look very good.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako... and Mayuri. Sorry, can you go buy something cold to drink?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And some of those cooling sheets that you put on your forehead would be nice, too.”[%p]
I felt bad for Lukako, but I probably didn’t want either of them hearing what we were about to discuss.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup, ok. Let’s go, Luka-kun.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, yeah...”[%p]
Lukako seemed interested in hearing about what was going on, but still, he went along with Mayuri.[%p]
What happened next was the problem.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kana-san...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kagari, where have you been, and what have you been doing?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“What...?”[%p]
Suzuha opened her mouth the second Mayuri and Lukako left. Her words were as sharp as a knife blade, and Kana looked terrified.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What the hell were you thinking when you—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, Suzuha. She’s lost her memories.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What did you say?”[%p]
I explained what had brought Kana here.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Amnesia... Then she doesn’t even know where she’s been?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, but there’s something we need to find out first.”[%p]
Whether or not she was really Shiina Kagari.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kana-san.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Oh, yes?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you remember what we were just talking about?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Sì...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you want to do? Should we wait for you to recover a little more before we continue?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“No, I’m fine.”[%p]
She was clutching her Upa so hard that her fingertips had gone white.[%p]
But there was a light in her eyes as she looked up at Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok, let’s get back to it. Suzuha, what makes you say that this is Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That Upa. Kagari never let go of it. She said it was a present from her mom that would keep her safe.”[%p]
Kana slowly opened her hand. The tiny old Upa was staring up at us with a silly look on its face.[%p]
A present from her mom.[%p]
A present from Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kana-san said that Upa was the one thing she had with her.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“That’s right. I woke up without my memories, and the only thing I had was this key chain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Woke up?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Sì...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Woke up where?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“A mountain path in Chiba. Near the prefecture’s border.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“The priest of a nearby temple happened to be passing by, and he found me lying on the ground...”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“I stayed there for a while.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“But they said the temple was a place of spiritual training, and they couldn’t let a girl stay there for very long...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So they sent you to Lukako’s place?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Yes. The priest thought that Luka-kun was a girl.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“So they thought it would be good to send me to a home with a girl my age.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I never thought of that. If only I’d known you were so close...”[%p]
The guest that Lukako had mentioned a few days ago was probably that priest.[%p]
Which means that Kana—no, Shiina Kagari—had been there the whole time.[%p]
We’d been searching blindly for her, without any idea.[%p]
And she’d been there the whole time.[%p]
If only I’d taken Lukako’s call, we wouldn’t have had to go through all this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, Kana-san... did you remember anything when you heard the name Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Ad essere onesti, I don’t know. But it feels like I’ve heard it before.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“And...”[%p]
Kana’s words cut off as she looked at Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“That girl from before...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You mean Big Sis Mayu?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Big Sis Mayu?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s Shiina Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Mayuri...san... Somehow, when I saw her, I felt very warm.”[%p]
Even if she was Shiina Kagari, she would only have known Mayuri after she’d grown up.[%p]
But her appearance can’t have changed that much.[%p]
Which meant that it would make sense that seeing her would stir some feelings within Kagari.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey, can I see that again?”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Oh, sure...”[%p]
Kagari handed the old Upa over to Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah... this is definitely Kagari’s.”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Then does that mean I’m this Shiina Kagari girl?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think so. We can’t be sure yet, but that would make sense.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, I’m sure of it. This is Kagari. The key chain is proof of it. Big Sis Mayu gave this to Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But how could you have amnesia, of all things?”[%p]
The key chain probably did belong to Kagari.[%p]
But she also could have been gifted it by Shiina Kagari. Or she could’ve picked it up off the ground.[%p]
Of course, Suzuha said that the key chain was very important to Kagari.[%p]
It was unlikely that she’d drop it, or give it to someone.[%p]
Il che significava...[%p]
Then the door opened, and Mayuri poked her head through to see what was going on.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]Is... everything ok?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, sorry. Thanks for getting that.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Not at all...”[%p]
The drinks and cooling sheets were taken out of their plastic bags and put on the desk.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So, um...”[%p]
Lukako waited a moment for her to take a sip of the drinks he’d brought, and then spoke with a quavering voice.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So is Kana-san this Kagari-san girl that Amane-san was looking for?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... That’s probably the case.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m so glad! Now you at least know your name...”[%p]
[name]Kana[line]“Luka-kun...”[%p]
Kana—that is, Kagari—smiled gently when she saw how relieved Lukako was.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, but then, do you know where her real family is?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? No, that’s...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-Suzuha was Kagari-san’s neighbor when they were kids. But she moved twelve years ago, and hasn’t been able to find her since. Isn’t that right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Th-That’s right. And all of a sudden, I really started missing her, so I came to Uncle Okarin for help.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So that’s the situation. Which means that Suzuha doesn’t know anything about Kagari-san’s family, or where she lived.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ho capito...”[%p]
That was the only answer I could come up with.[%p]
If we told Kagari that she was a time traveler from the year 2036 who’d come here 12 years ago, it would only confuse her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now if only we could get her memories back, we could know exactly what happened.”[%p]
She’d learned her name and met both Suzuha and Mayuri.[%p]
Mayuri’s presence alone had to be a big deal.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Kagari-san?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Y-Yes?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s your last name? I didn’t hear it before. So I’d like to learn it.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Well, they say that it’s... Shiina.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! Then you’ve got the same last name as Mayushii! Mayushii’s last name is Shiina! Shiina Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Shiina...Mayuri-san...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah, that makes me happy! I’ve never met anybody with the same name as me.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Capisco...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup! So I’m really glad to meet you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Y-Yes. Nice to meet you, too.”[%p]
Mayuri was using her natural cheerfulness to try and open up to Kagari.[%p]
If it worked, maybe she could bring back her memories.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-kun told me you’ve got amnesia. Is that true?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That means you don’t know who you are, doesn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I see... That has to be really tough, huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Because that means you forgot about the people you love, right? Mayushii thinks that’s really, really sad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, um... I don’t really know how to say this, but Mayushii will help, too, so let’s do our best, ok?”[%p]
Mayuri smiled.[%p]
I could see Kagari’s eyes well up with tears.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“W-W-What’s wrong? Did Mayushii say something weird?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No, that’s not it... Just, hearing you say that made me so happy for some reason...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And it’s not just Mayushii! Okarin, Suzu-san, and Luka-kun all feel the same way.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes, of course! I’ll do anything I can.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Thank you, Luka-kun, Mayuri-san.”[%p]
I could leave Kagari to Mayuri and Lukako, and she’d be just fine.[%p]
The question was what to do now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, can you do me a favor?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can Kagari-san stay at your place a while longer?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In the meantime, we’ll try to figure out what she’s been doing until now.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“O-Of course. I don’t mind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that ok with you, too, Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...That’s fine.”[%p]
Suzuha probably wasn’t completely happy with that, but she nodded anyway.[%p]
Our first priority now was getting back Kagari’s memories.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then I can see you if I go to Luka-kun’s place, right? Can Mayushii come over to play?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Of course. Right, Kagari-san?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Right!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha, you should try to drop by as often as possible, too. That’s probably the best way to get her memories back.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okey-dokey.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, right. Um, if we’re not having a Christmas Party, I’d like to have a New Year’s party.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Can you help too, Kagari-san? It would really make me happy.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh? Can I?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Of course! Right, Luka-kun?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yeah. Let’s all have a party together.”[%p]
Any time you got three girls together, they’d start chattering like birds.[%p]
The girls—although one of them was a guy—began to chatter away.[%p]
I had my own work to do.[%p]
First—[%p]
I had to let Moeka know we’d found her.[%p]
Knowing Moeka,[%p]
she’d respond almost immediately—[%p]
That was all I needed to do for Moeka.[%p]
But I was still interested in the group who’d been looking for Kagari.[%p]
And I also wanted to know what she was doing lying on a mountain path.[%p]
What was she doing out there?[%p]
And with only an Upa?[%p]
Could she have been running from someone?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, can I have a second?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes, what is it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d like you to try to keep Kagari-san from leaving the shrine as much as possible.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Huh? Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t ask the reason. Please.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes, all right. If you say so, Okabe-san.”[%p]
La prudenza non è mai troppa.[%p]
If it was nothing, then that was fine.[%p]
Once Kagari got her memories back, I’d know for sure.[%p]
Nobody knew when that would be, though.[%p]
