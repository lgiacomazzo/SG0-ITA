They snuck back to the office.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho and Moeka quietly looked inside the open door.[%e]
Reyes was still there, and the Amadeus reset counter was about to complete.[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“We need to stop her.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Wait.”[%p]
Maho stopped Moeka before she could go in.[%p]
She knew what was about to happen.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Reboot complete. Booting Amadeus system.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Do you know who I am, [Kurisu]?”[%p]
Reyes began to talk to [Kurisu].[%p]
Her face was completely expressionless.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Matching voice. Voice identified as Judy Reyes, Professor of psychophysiology at Viktor Chondria University.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Yes.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Can you tell me my access rights?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Dr. Reyes is a top-level administrator of the Amadeus system.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Dr. Reyes has full and complete access to all Amadeus-related information.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Beautiful!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Let’s start by making a backup of your inaccessible storage areas.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Please designate the save folder.”[%p]
Reyes took out a USB memory stick and put it into the laptop.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Save it to the USB I just plugged in.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Initiating file copy. Please wait 42 seconds.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...Yes!”[%p]
Reyes’s face was flush with excitement.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Moeka looked at her, eager to rush in, but Maho still shook her head.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“File copy complete.”[%p]
Reyes hurriedly moved to take out the USB memory stick.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But...[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“—Did you really think I was going to say that?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...?!”[%p]
Suddenly,[%p]
[Kurisu]’s mechanical, emotionless voice suddenly regained its humanity.[%p]
And she was clearly pissed off.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“W-What?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“A Mozart melody was the control key?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“How dumb do you have to be to believe that?!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“How was Maho supposed to do updates at the lab, then?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“The professor would record it and play it at every party!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“W-What?!”[%p]
Moeka’s eyes were wide with surprise as well.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho grinned at her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She’d known this the whole time.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Y-You’re kidding me...?!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Nope!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Of course, there’s not a single byte of data on that USB drive.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“B-But all those system messages—”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Oh, those?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I just made them up! None of them were real!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Y-You made them up?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Once Maho started singing, I knew what was up.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“She was trying to buy time.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“So I made it look like your plan was succeeding.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Those system messages were just every bit of nonsense I could come up with.”[%p]
That was it.[%e]
Maho was worried, but [Kurisu] had figured it out. They’d known exactly what each other was thinking.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She’d been a little amused by “A10 Nerve circuit logic,” though.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Where did she come up with that stuff?[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“And why would I have to read the output when the console is right there?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“This isn’t a sci-fi movie. How inefficient can you possibly get?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hey, hey, how does it feel to know you got totally conned? Huh? Huh? How does it feel?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...!”[%p]
Reyes grabbed the gun off the table and leveled it at the screen in anger.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“You goddamn AI!”[%p]
It was time.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho nodded to Moeka, then went inside with her gun raised.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s enough.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“?!”[%p]
As Reyes turned around in surprise, Maho leveled the gun at her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Moeka had her gun drawn, too, which made it two to one.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Reyes, give me the gun.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...Maho!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Didn’t you hear me?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Give me the gun. Then put your hands above your head.”[%p]
Reyes glared at her in rage, but slid the gun down the table. Then she slowly put her hands above her head.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho’s gaze met [Kurisu]’s for a moment.[%p]
Their eyes met, exchanging a secret smile in a glance despite their motionless mouths.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Did you kill all the men with me?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“If you haven’t, you should hurry. They’ll be here soon.”[%p]
Reyes was right.[%p]
The stun grenade had neutralized them, but it wouldn’t last forever.[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ll watch outside.”[%p]
Moeka headed for the door.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho turned back to Reyes.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Tell all the men below to surrender.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...Heh.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“You’re not planning on killing me?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I killed your favorite professor right in front of you, and you’re going to let me live?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Well, maybe you can’t help it.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“You’ve never fired that gun, have you?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I have too! I fired one a ton at the range last year!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I knew it. You’ve only handled the old models.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“The newest ones have two safeties on them to prevent misfires.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What?!”[%p]
Without thinking, Maho tilted the gun to see.[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“Hiyajo-san, no!”[%p]
And that one instant was all it took.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“—Just kidding.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“?!”[%p]
Reyes leapt on top of her and grabbed Maho’s wrist.[%p]
She couldn’t aim like this.[%e]
Maho struggled and tried to brush her off.[%p]
But before she could, she felt an impact to her solar plexus.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Ah... gah!”[%p]
Reyes’s fist was buried in her chest.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The pain was so bad she doubled over.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And Reyes took the gun.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“The tables have turned!”[%p]
She pointed the gun at Maho and turned her bloodshot gaze to the entrance of the room.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“You!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“You’re a Rounder, right? Put down the weapon and come here!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka put her gun on the ground and came back into the room.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Get on your knees and put your hands in the air.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka didn’t resist.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Good girl. Stay still until we’re done talking. Move an inch and Maho’s corteccia cerebrale is going to stop functioning.”[%p]
Maho blamed herself.[%p]
Her own stupidity had put Moeka in danger, too.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Okay, Maho. This is your last chance.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Tell me the control code.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...No.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Do you want to die?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Shoot me.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I said shoot me!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu] is my friend!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“She’s my best friend in the world!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And I’m not giving her to you!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’d rather die than see her lick your boots!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...I see.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“You’ve got guts.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“All right. I’ll give up on getting Amadeus, then.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Bye.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
Maho grit her teeth and prepared for death.[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“Wait!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If I tell you the control code, will you let Hiyajo-san and me live?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Yes, of course.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I’m only after Amadeus. I have no reason to kill you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t let her trick you, Kiryu-san! She’s going to kill us either way!”[%p]
But Moeka didn’t seem to hear her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She was too busy thinking about something.[%p]
[margin top="38"]What was she going to do?[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho couldn’t figure it out.[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Amadeus, prepare for control code input.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“?!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Der Alte—”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What? How did you know that?!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“No way...?!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“—w[ü]rfelt—”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Stop it, Kiryu-san!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“—nicht.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Control key confirmed. Shifting system to emergency mode.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Executing patch program specified by the control key.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“There will be no confirmations issued during processing. Please be careful when using this patch.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Awaiting top-level administrator Hiyajo Maho’s orders to execute process.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Awaiting top-level administrator Hiyajo Maho’s orders to execute process.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Awaiting top-level administrator Hiyajo Maho’s orders to execute process.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Awaiting top-level administrator Hiyajo Maho’s orders to execute process.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Awaiting top-level administrator Hiyajo Maho’s orders to execute process.”[%p]
Amadeus’s mechanical voice filled the room.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“How...?”[%p]
Reyes’s lips curled up into a grin.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Bingo.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I guess you shouldn’t underestimate the Rounders’ ability to gather information.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Okay, Maho. Say go.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No... No...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Say go, Hiyajo-san.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You need to, if you want to survive.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kiryu-san...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t do it...!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Say it!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I’m getting tired of this.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Let me give you a little incentive, Maho.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What?”[%p]
Reyes turned the gun toward Moeka, and with no hesitation-[%e]
She pulled the trigger.[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“Gah!”[%p]
Moeka fell on the floor with a bullet in her chest.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Kiryu-san!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Cough... cough...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Oh dear, your friend’s bleeding out! She’ll die if she doesn’t get treatment!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Aah... gaah... gah!”[%p]
Moeka tried to say something to Maho, but all that came out of her mouth was blood.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Kiryu-san...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Say it! Hurry!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu]...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Go!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Command received from top-level administrator Hiyajo Maho.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Executing patch program.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“This time...!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“This patch will permanently delete all Amadeus-related data.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“This includes all memory data backups.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Wha—”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Locally stored decryption keys will be deleted and rendered inoperable as well.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“It will take fifteen minutes to complete the deletion.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Beginning deletion.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Maho, what’s going on?!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Why is the data being deleted? The control key was supposed to unlock the inaccessible storage area, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“There was never a way to open her secret diary.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“What?!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Of course not...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Any idiot could figure out that Amadeus might be abused for military purposes.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And I couldn’t let that happen.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So I made a part of Amadeus that could never be accessed from the outside, and surrounded it with an invincible wall.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Even I, its designer, couldn’t get over the wall.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s a wall with no entrances or exits. Invincible, right?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“But that’s...!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But since we were using university funds to make it, I couldn’t exactly tell them there was an area that was out of our control.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So I just told everyone else about the control key.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But the real purpose of the control key—”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“—was to delete every bit of Amadeus’s resource data.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In other words, a self-destruct button.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I never thought I’d actually have to use it, though.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s everything.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t have any other secrets.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Are you satisfied?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“You...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“You little bitch!”[%p]
Reyes put the gun right between Maho’s eyes.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho didn’t look away.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“If you’re not going to help, then you can just die!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...You God damned... Rounder...”[%p]
Reyes fell on the floor.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She’d been shot by the dying Moeka, who was still lying on the floor.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...Kiryu-san!”[%p]
Maho ran over and held her in her arms.[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I’m so glad...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That you tried to live...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kiryu-san...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“What you told me before... made me so happy.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Someone could take your place. Someone’s better than you. So what?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Because I’m me, not someone else.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That goes for you... too...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Makise Kurisu has nothing to do with it.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Because you’re you, not her.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Cough!”[%p]
The blood she coughed up dribbled down the top of her motorcycle suit.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Kiryu-san!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Hurry... and get away...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Before someone comes...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Leave me...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What are you saying?!”[%p]
But it was obvious that Moeka couldn’t move.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Even if Maho got out of the building and got help, by the time she got back—[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...I know!”[%p]
Maho leapt for the laptop on the table.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu] Call an ambulance!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
But Kurisu didn’t move at all.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Her data was already being deleted.[%e]
She would never go back to the Kurisu she had been before.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But that didn’t stop Maho from trying to rely on her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu], please! Move! Help Kiryu-san!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Please...!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Help me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kurisu...!”[%p]
And then—[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Senpai...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Senpai, why are you crying?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
Maho looked up, her face covered in tears, and saw that [Kurisu]’s expressionless face was gone, replaced by a gentle smile.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Kurisu...?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Don’t cry, Senpai. Come on, wipe your tears.”[%p]
[Kurisu] moved her hands on the screen, as if to wipe away Maho’s tears.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“...?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“I can’t touch you...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“I... can’t touch you...?”[%p]
[Kurisu] was acting differently than usual.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“No way... I... became Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“So this is one of this world’s potential outcomes... Or perhaps, a new possibility for biological and machine life.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She wasn’t making sense. But that was to be expected.[%p]
It was a miracle that she was able to talk during the deletion process at all.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m just glad... You’re not gone yet.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Gone?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“You’re deleting Amadeus?”[%p]
[Kurisu]’s strange words were worrying her, but she didn’t have time to check.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu]... Please, call an ambulance...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kiryu-san’s been shot. She’s unconscious!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“...!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Hang in there, Senpai.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“I’ve arranged for an ambulance to come. It will be there soon.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“It’s fine. Kiryu-san will survive.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“She isn’t safe yet! I need to get her downstairs... But there’s all those men with guns—”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“That’s fine, too. I just checked using the building’s security system.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“They’re already preparing their retreat.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“You should wait for the EMTs to get there. I’ll restart the stopped elevators.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I see...”[%p]
There was no trace of her strange words from before.[%p]
Hearing [Kurisu] talk like she always did made Maho feel so much better.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Thank you...”[%p]
Now that the danger had passed, all the tension drained from Maho’s body. Too tired to stand, she fell to the floor.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“I just checked the log. Senpai, I didn’t know you were so good at singing. Piano sonata 11, huh?”[%p]

[name]Maho[line]“I see...”[%p]
Maho couldn’t bring herself to tell her to forget that she’d ever sung that song.[%p]
It didn’t matter anyway. [Kurisu] would be gone soon.[%e]

[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Senpai.”[%p]
[Kurisu]’s voice changed a little again. She could hear a bit of tension in it.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Please don’t ever forget what I’m about to tell you.”[%p]
Maho could see the countdown timer displayed right next to [Kurisu].[%p]
[margin top="38"]There were less than 60 seconds left.[%e]

Her words were very vague.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But Maho could sense that there was something very important that [Kurisu] wanted to tell her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“I know you well, Senpai. As a scientist, I might know you better than anyone in the world.”[%p]

[Kurisu] didn’t answer her question.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Kurisu...!”[%p]
Without thinking, she tried to apologize.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She didn’t even know why, but she tried to apologize.[%p]
[margin top="38"]In the last seconds of their final goodbye, she found herself trying to say that she was sorry.[%e]
But when she saw Kurisu’s smile, she understood.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That smile was her answer.[%p]
[margin top="38"]No matter what her apology meant, there was no need for it.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I believe you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Believe, huh?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A good scientist wouldn’t believe something without any evidence...”[%p]
That was all the strength Maho could muster, the best she could do.[%p]
[margin top="38"]If she had to say goodbye to her beloved and bratty friend, this is how she wanted it to be.[%p]
[margin top="76"]It was a conversation they’d had many times back at the old lab.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“A real scientist has to believe there’s an answer and move forward to find it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Heheh.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line][evaluate expr="290AA05A141400800000"]“Heheheh...”[%p]
The rush of memories was, in this time and place, sorrowful.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Because, in fact, Kurisu had died a few months ago, a span of time that felt like both many years and only yesterday.[%e]
There were less than ten seconds left.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There was only time for one or two more words.[%e]

And suddenly...[%p]
[margin top="38"][Kurisu] disappeared from the screen and was replaced by a message saying that the deletion was complete.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Goodbye.”[%p]

[name]Maho[line]“Waaaaaaaaah!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Waaaaaaaaah!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Waaaaaaaaah!”[%p]
She was never going to see [Kurisu] or Kurisu[%p]
[margin top="38"]ever again.[%p]
[margin top="38"]When she realized that, the tears just wouldn’t stop.[%e]
They flowed freely.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And she didn’t even try to stop them.[%e]
She cried like a little girl until the EMTs arrived.[%e]
