[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We will now execute our new operation.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My future self told me that Steins Gate waits beyond several futures.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if the future that awaits us is a path of thorns, it will not be useless.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know. It will take an incredible amount of time to reach the door we seek.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Many different Organizations may rise up to stop us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I’ll start over as many times as it takes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pray for my success... El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
After I finished my phone call, I realized that everyone was staring at me.[%p]
Please don’t look at me that way.[%p]
I’m embarrassed, too.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What... did I just see?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is... I know! It’s like a ceremony!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A ceremony... Right...”[%p]
Yes, this was a ceremony.[%p]
A ceremony to stop my fears from getting the best of me again.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Wait, Okarin-san. Don’t tell me you did that around Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I-I’m not Okabe! I’m Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Are you messing with me?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maho-tan, don’t give him too much of a hard time. He’s still trying to figure things out.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow... so this is Hououin Kyouma-san, huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right. He’s the insane mad scientist!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And the reincarnation of an ancient [color index="280AA02D1400"]alchemist[color index="800000"], nya.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“He’s also the master of the scuola di spada Seishin Zanma.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry, Dad. I’m having trouble keeping up with this.”[%p]
Please don’t stare at me like that.[%p]
It’s breaking my heart...[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So, what exactly is the plan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ahem.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First, let me make something clear. Our final goal is a future where the Third World War never occurs.”[%p]
Just like I’d told myself a second ago, I didn’t expect to get to the linea di universo we wanted—the Steins Gate linea di universo—immediately.[%p]
Just like I’d had to build up to the linea di universo Beta little by little, I’d have to go through many pasts, and many futures.[%p]
And to do that, I first had to right this linea di universo’s future.[%p]
This world had lost Kurisu, and the price for that was dire indeed.[%p]
But I wouldn’t let the future that awaited us[%p]
be so full of suffering and pain.[%p]
I wouldn’t let it happen.[%p]
Everything had to begin with that,[%p]
even if the future before us would end up never having happened at all.[%p]
That was my responsibility, since I had chosen this world.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I told you all that I’ve been through several linea di universo changes since coming to the linea di universo Beta, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First, we need to remove the cause of those changes.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What is it, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Makise Kurisu’s laptop and hard drive, and her memories that are stored in Amadeus.”[%p]
The time machine paper contained on the hard drive and all of her memories relating to it.[%p]
All of those linea di universo changes...[%p]
It was safe to assume that they’d been caused by Stratfo and others fighting over them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thus, the final goal of our operation is to destroy Kurisu’s laptop and hard drive, and delete her memory data.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You can’t delete Kurisu’s memory data! You can’t...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Are you serious?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But those memories are all we have left of her.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“They’re all we have to prove that she was ever here.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t want to delete them...”[%p]
I knew how she felt.[%p]
Until a few days ago, I would’ve agreed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then you’re ok with them being misused?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s not...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“On my way to this linea di universo, I saw her memories start wars again and again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And many people have been caught up in that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari was just one of them.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
What happened to Kagari in the past several years—that probably hadn’t changed in this linea di universo.[%p]
Which meant that was just another tragedy caused by the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Vaso di Pandora[color index="800000"] that was Kurisu’s memories.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And I’ve experienced that world of data, too. I’ve experienced its cold.”[%p]
That’s right, I knew...[%p]
I knew how cold that world was.[%p]
It was a world inside a tiny box, with no past, present, or future.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you want to leave Kurisu in that cold, dark world forever?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve got proof that she existed right here.”[%p]
I put my finger to my head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve got what we remember, and we’ve got the chance to build a peaceful world where a Third World War never happens.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Isn’t that all the proof we need that she was alive?”[%p]
Maho fell silent as the whole group turned toward her.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s really cheesy. If Kurisu heard that, she’d laugh at you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sure.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But maybe it’s a cheesy cliché because it’s true.”[%p]
Maho’s dark frown became a smile.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’ll do what you want me to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, you’ve got Kurisu’s laptop and hard drive, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yup, I got it from Maho-tan and hid it somewhere it wouldn’t be found easily.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As soon as we’re done with Amadeus, destroy them.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re sure?”[%p]
He looked back at Maho, and this time, she nodded.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah. But let me do it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Kk.”[%p]
The problem now was Amadeus.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maho, do you still have access to Amadeus’s server?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, I should. Hashida-san, can I borrow your computer?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Oh, sure. Just a second.”[%p]
Daru motioned for her to stop with one hand, then started typing something into the keyboard.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What are you doing, Daru-nyan?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Just some tricks to make sure our [color index="280AA02D1400"]IP[color index="800000"] isn’t tracked... Kk. Go ahead.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho took over from Daru at the computer.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s strange... I can’t access it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You mean you’ve got the wrong password?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I wouldn’t make that mistake. Do you know how many times I’ve entered that password?”[%p]
Maho tried the password a few more times, but she still couldn’t access the server.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Tch—Looks like my access has been revoked.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What’s going on with this? I’ll call the professor.”[%p]
Maho took out her phone and called Dr. Leskinen.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She put the phone next to her ear for a moment, then frowned and put it down.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No good. He’s not picking up.”[%p]
She tried calling Dr. Reyes, too, but that didn’t work, either.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Jeez! What is going on with this thing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I guess it wouldn’t be that easy, huh?”[%p]
If Maho’s access rights had been taken away, that must have meant someone was about to do something.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s try another approach.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you hack the Viktor Chondria University servers?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Kk. Just give me a second.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re making it sound easy. Our lab’s security is pretty tight.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. Daru’s a super hacka.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You mean a hacker, man.”[%p]
He had broken SERN’s security in just 20 hours. I had absolute faith in him.[%p]
Daru and Maho were staring at the screen and discussing something.[%p]
He was probably asking her for details to make his hacking more efficient.[%p]
I needed to do what I could while I waited.[%p]
I went back into the development room and opened up a box that had just arrived that day.[%p]
Mayuri looked over my shoulder into the box.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, it’s a microwave!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not using it to heat up your fried chicken, ok?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Too bad... I was going to make some Juicy Chicken Number One for everybody if they were hungry.”[%p]
First, I needed to reconstruct the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio).[%p]
After that, I’d have Maho help me make the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
On my way back from the future, I’d memorized every bit of how it worked, so it didn’t take very long.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hashida-san... You’re amazing.”[%p]
It was about 30 minutes later when I heard Maho’s awed voice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you get it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“For a top-quality hacker like me, this is nothing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The name super hacka isn’t just for show, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right, see if you can find Amadeus’s data.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hold on, I’m opening it now...”[%p]
I swallowed and looked at the screen as I listened to the mouse click.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s gone...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Amadeus, Kurisu’s memories... all the folders that should be there are gone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So someone took it already?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](Wait...)[%p]
I unlocked my phone and called up the home screen.[%p]
Amadeus’s icon was still there.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, do you think you could access Amadeus from this app?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
Maho looked over at my phone.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t know... If Amadeus’s data is gone from the server, I don’t think it would work...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Give it a try.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was just thinking about what I’d do if it connected. I need to be careful.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. Someone might be watching you.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it, Daru?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Look... There’s a folder with another lock on it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Which one?”[%p]
Maho leaned forward and stared at the monitor.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s strange. That didn’t used to be there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s pretty heavily secured. Way more than the rest of the system.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Was that where Amadeus was moved?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But who would do that? Only Dr. Leskinen has that level of authority.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe Dr. Leskinen’s up to something and we don’t know it. Or maybe something happened to him...”[%p]
Neither possibility was appealing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, we’ll leave that folder alone for now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Next I want you to hack Stratfo’s servers.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Stratfo? Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’re probably involved in all of this. You’ve done it once before. Can you do it again?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, how did you know that? Are you psychic?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who do you think I am? The Insane Mad Scientist knows all.”[%p]
“Give me a sec,” he said, as he typed something else into the computer.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Stratfo’s servers... got it.”[%p]
I could tell he’d done it once before.[%p]
This time he got through a lot faster than it took him to break into the university.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So you just want me to find data on that Amadeus system?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hold on!”[%p]
Maho leaned her tiny body forward again and took the mouse from Daru. She clicked on an icon.[%p]
The screen filled with some kind of text.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“This is a report...”[%p]
She opened several more files, but since they were written in English, we couldn’t read them.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What is this...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are these reports about?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Experiments. Stratfo was experimenting on humans.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Experimenting... on humans...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It looks like Stratfo was working on human memory transplantation.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“They did a lot of experiments trying to transfer memories from one person to another.”[%p]
Memory transplant experiments...[%p]
That was—[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“They started with animals, but by the end they were using live humans.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“They used people with no relatives as subjects. Kids, adults, people from different ethnic backgrounds...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She looked down at the report again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it? Is there something else?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It looks like they’re about to start a new memory transplant experiment.”[%p]
It was safe to assume the experiments had something to do with the time machine.[%p]
They were trying to force open the black box of Kurisu’s memories in order to gain information about the time machine.[%p]
Even if they couldn’t get the password for the laptop from Amadeus, if they could access her memories directly, it would give them everything they needed.[%p]
It was just like what had been done to Kagari in the last linea di universo, but on a more advanced level.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our priority now is finding Kurisu’s memory data. Daru, think it’s there?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
He took the mouse back from Maho and sighed.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nope... No luck. I’m not seeing anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
What was going on?[%p]
Hadn’t Stratfo stolen the Amadeus data from Viktor Chondria?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That university server is the most suspicious. The one with the locked folder.”[%p]
Which meant that they were working without stealing the data?[%p]
Did they hack it like we did? Or...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s the plan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...We’ll believe Maho. Daru, can you get us in?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can, but it’s gonna be a pain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How long is it going to take?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I couldn’t tell you. Might take more than 12 hours.”[%p]
If Daru said so, it must’ve been really heavily protected.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And if they catch me hacking halfway through, it’s all over.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
We needed to hack in to get rid of Kurisu’s memory data.[%p]
And until Daru finished, we needed to keep Stratfo distracted.[%p]
The problem was... how?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happens to my location data when I’m talking to Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It all gets recorded. Of course, the people who’ve got Amadeus’s program can see it.”[%p]
I thought so.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The question is, do we contact her or not?”[%p]
First, I needed to see if the app even worked anymore.[%p]
If it did... I had an idea.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maho, can I ask you something crazy?”[%p]
