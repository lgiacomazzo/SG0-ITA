Tutturu♪! Okarin, are things going okay with  Mr. Seminar?
Yeah, no problem.
There was a little accident.
I’m not sure.
I see! That’s great!
I can’t wait to see what kind of seminar it will be.
Mayushii wishes she could’ve seen it, too.
It may be a little too hard for you to follow.
You’re right.
Okay, I don’t want to get in your way! Bye!
Huh? Did something happen?
I almost ran into somebody I really would rather avoid...
You okay?
If you’re having a hard time, I think it would be okay to leave halfway through.
I can’t do that. I’m all right for now. Thanks.
You’ll be fine. Mayushii guarantees it.
I’m just having trouble paying attention.
There’s a seminar I want to attend, so I’m not getting anywhere with my work.
I see. You’re nervous, huh?
Just tell yourself that if you work hard, you can go see Seminar-san as a reward.
And then you’ll focus on the work right in front of you.
I can’t believe you get to go to a fancy party! Die in a fire, Mr. Fancy-Pants.
You could’ve helped too, you know.
All the food here looks so good.
There’s nobody to talk to and I’m bored.
No way.
Then don’t complain.
But I’m jealous you get to go to a party. There’s lots of hot rich girls, right?
It’s mostly guys, I think. Lots of older scientists.
Okarin... Hang in there, man.
Is that all you ever think about?
Bring me back a doggie bag.
Hell no! I can’t do that!
You can do what you set your mind to! There is no limit but the vast blue sky! I can come get it right now if you want me to.
Are you that hungry?
Fine. Okay, I’ll get you something.
But I refuse.
Well, that kind of place has never been your style, Okarin.
That’s right. The only person I know here is my own professor, so I’m not sure what to do.

The Mysterious Sukettos have at last appeared in Akihabara, nya!
You haven’t heard of the ancient urban legends of Akihabara, nya?
I know about a few of them, but the Sukettos are new to me.
If a group of three people sits in the back seat of a certain maid café...
They appear!!
Or so they say, nya! =゜w゜=
No one ever knew which Maid Café it was...
UNTIL NOW, NYA!
It’s MayQueen, nyaaaaaaaaaaaa!
I-Is everything okay?
Everything’s fine, nya!
They just join your game in the middle of a raid and killsteal all the mobs, nya.
Hang on a second.
Okarin, do you...
I see. So mew know about it too, Okarin.
Then you know there’s no turning back now, nya?
Then I will say no more, nya!
Together, we shall ascend to those highest heights, nya!
This is one of the hidden doors of Akihabara that leads to the truth, nya!
??????
If you know naught of it, then very well, nya!
It saddens me that we cannot journey together, but if my sacrifice shall put an end to this,
then I go through the door with gladness, nya!
Okabe-san, may I have a moment of your time?
Not today.
I’m meeting someone right now.
Is it important?
I see... Sorry to bother you.
Really sorry. We can talk about it later.
Um... A girl?
Huh? Why?
No... I just got that feeling somehow.
...
But he’s a guy.
Oh, I see.
That’s right.
Yes.
That’s right.
Yes!
I’m sorry. Goodbye.
No, it’s not that important.
Can it wait, then?
All right. I’ll contact you later.
Sorry.
No, please don’t worry about it!
Got a sec, Uncle Okarin?
You sure?
If you’re wondering about whether to hit Sampo or Go Go Curry for dinner, I can help you with that. Anything more involved, no.
Those aren’t the only places I eat!
Forget it. I’ll handle it myself.
You can talk to me about it another time.
Listen, what do you think I should do about Mom and Dad?
What do you mean?
I just can’t see them getting together like this.
Well, you’re right.
Uncle Okarin, is there anything you can do?
You know there’s nothing I can do to help with that!
You’re right. Yeah.
It kind of hurts that you just gave up that easily.
It doesn’t seem to be your kind of thing, Uncle.
Yes? No? Answer me!
This is why Big Sis Mayu has such a hard time.
Why are we talking about Mayuri now?
Who knows?
How did things go with [Kurisu] after that?
No problems.
Can we do something about her mouth?
I want to talk to [Maho], too.
I see. Anything you can tell me, no matter how small, would be a help.
That she’s interested in Otome Road, maybe?
What’s that?
A place where a whole world you know nothing about exists.
Wait. I’ll look it up.
Bad idea. That darkness is very deep.
If there’s anything that seems off, I’ll let you know.
Would you? I know it’s a lot of trouble.
[Kurisu]? She can be really nasty.
She’s what you call a tsundere.
A tsundere?
I don’t know what that is, but are you sure you didn’t just tick her off?
[Kurisu] does not suffer fools gladly.
Huh?!
What? No! Absolutely not!
Don’t say that. Let me switch between the two of them.
Not happening. Not for you.
Sorry, it was a joke.
I didn’t think you’d get so mad.
If you knew your electronic double could be spilling secrets about your private life and you’d have no clue, it would freak you out, too.
I mean, I know it shouldn’t happen. But that doesn’t mean it won’t.
You’re right.
So, can you let me switch between them?
Hey, hey, Okarin. What’s the best color for a school swimsuit?
The hell are you talking about?
Who gives a crap?
White. Definitely.
Well, I’m playing this H-game, and it just popped up as a choice.
I was wondering what color you’d pick.
Honestly I would’ve rather asked Mayu-shi or Luka-shi or Faris-tan.
They’d call the cops on your ass.
...Yeah.
So I had no choice but to ask you!
So, what color? Don’t get embarrassed, just tell me!
Ask Suzuha.
NOT A CHANCE.
She’d slit my throat.
Don’t be like that. Tell me, man!
It may be the most important choice I make in my entire life!
Huh? What do you mean?
My intuition tells me that if I get this wrong, there’ll be real trouble!
What the hell are you doing?
Hmm? H-game. Why?
I see.
Excellent choice. Very few normies would pick a white school swimsuit. You might be more of a pervert than me.
I know, right?
I actually just picked a color at random.
Nice, Okarin! I’m taking that advice.
Stop with the commentary.
Hey, Okarin. What time are you getting home today?
Huh? Something going on?
I shouldn’t be that late.
I won’t be coming home tonight.
I met your mom and she asked me to cook tonight.
She has to go to a meeting for the shopping street, and she wasn’t sure what to do for dinner.
So Mayushii said she’d do the cooking, and she said that was okay!
Are you sure? You’re busy too, aren’t you, Mayuri? You don’t have to do it.
It’s fine! I’ll make something good! Come home soon!
I see.
Really?
Seriously?
I’ll be waiting!
I see. Will you eat dinner at home?
Hm... Maybe. I guess.
Okay! I’ll have something ready!
Huh? Why?
Your mom asked me to.
I just remembered! Some guys from school wanted to go out tonight.
Yeah? That’s a shame. I was going to make something good.
Sorry.
It’s okay! I’ll just make some for your dad then.
You don’t have to do that. I’ll get him something on my way back.
It’s okay! Leave it to Mayushii!
Sorry, Dad.
???
Okarin’s turned into a delinquent!
I have not.
The professor just asked me to help with some things.
Oh! You scared me!
Don’t work too hard, okay?
I hope you come home soon.
I’m about to reveal an important secret to you, nya! [linebreak]=゜w゜=
Come on, just let me say it, nya!
It’s probably just more made-up nonsense, right?
It’s really hard keeping up with all the stuff you say.
Mew’ve changed, Okarin! Will you never go back to the old you? Will you never go back to being Kyouma, nya?
Okarin’s getting excited, nya!
Of course! Secrets are always exciting.
You know it, nya!
So, what’s the secret?
Daru-nyan and Yuki-nyan went on a date!
Why are you blushing, nya?
Well, it’s a girl’s secret...
What are you imagining, nya? It’s probably not that, nya!
It’s about Daru-nyan and Yuki-nyan!
Oh, that?
You don’t want to know their secret, nya?
Daru’s not a girl.
That’s true, nya.
What about Yuki-nyan’s secret?
Don’t mew want to knooooooooow it? =゜w゜=
Suzuha would probably kill me. I’ll pass.
You really don’t want to know, nya? =゜w゜=
You really, really don’t want to know, nya?
Nope.
You may not get another chance, nya!
=゜w゜=
No need to think about it, nya!
If you don’t find out now, when will you find out, nya?
Be true to your desires, nya!
Okarin... You’re toying with poor little Faris, aren’t mew?
You nyaughty boy.
All right. I won’t do something that would upset you, nya.
It’s not that it upsets me...
I’ve just gotten a lot more careful after a certain someone almost sued me for sexual harassment.
That’s an amazing secret of yours, nya.
Oh, oops.
Nyahaha! I’ve got the evidence saved forever on my phone, nya.
So, who’s the girl, nya? [linebreak]=゜w゜=
Not telling you. I’ll take it to my grave.
Forget it, nya!
About Kagari...
Is there something bothering you?
Did you find a way to get her memories back?
You worried about her?
I’m honestly a little relieved that Kagari lost her memories.
I’m scared that they might come back.
I’m sure she hates me.
But you still want them to come back anyway, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Dwelling on the past won’t help.
It just kind of bothers me.
Sorry. Don’t tell anyone about this.
Got it.
No, not yet.
That’s not it.
She’s just so different than the Kagari I know that I’m not sure how to approach her.
Just be normal.
My “normal” tends to scare people.
That’s not true.
It doesn’t sound convincing at all when you say it.
Then why not ask Yuki-san for help?
Are you just being a jerk?
I’m not being a jerk. I’m serious.
I’ll think about it.
That’s right. Of course!
Then tell her.
But I can’t do anything to help.
Just be with her, that’s enough.
You’re the only person around from before she lost her memories.
If she talks with you, they might come back.
I see.
You’re right.
Thanks.
Got here safe, nya!
In Ikebukuro!
Mayushii made it home fine!
No problems.
Okarin! Okarin! Big news!
What’s up?
Can it wait?
Sorry. I can’t help with that.
You remember what happened yesterday, right?
So I was just talking with Nae-chan on RINE.
And then she told me about her dreams for the future.
Nae’s dreams, huh?
What were they?
First one.
She wants to get good at badminton.
You said “first.” Does that mean there’s a second?
Second:
She wants to get good at fighting games.
Third:
She wants to decorate the Braun Tube Workshop so it looks pretty.
Fourth:
She wants a telescope.
Is that a dream?
She says lately she’s liked looking at the stars.
She must’ve gotten it from you.
She seems like she’s interested in space.
Nae-chan’s so strong. She’s a very strong girl.
You’re right.
Oh, Mayushii is okay, too.
Oh, sorry.
You’re busy, right? Am I bothering you?
Especially after what happened yesterday.
Sorry. I’ll ask you about it later.
Oh, it’s fine. It’s fine. It’s nothing big.
Actually, I think I’m just gonna say one thing.
Nae’s really strong.
Mayushii was so impressed.
I see. You were cheering her up, huh? Thanks.
I haven’t said anything yet.
Huh? You didn’t? So, what’s up?
Oh, um... uh...
What’s up?
It’s about Nae-chan.
I thought that maybe if I told you, Nae-chan would get mad.
Does she really hate me that much?
She’s a young girl. I think she’s kind of embarrassed around older men.
You were trying to cheer her up, right? Does she look okay?
Yeah. We were just talking on RINE.
I think when she grows up, she’ll be a wonderful woman.
I see. I can’t wait.
Yeah. Okay, sorry to bother you.
There was actually some kind of important stuff I wanted to tell you, too.
Okabe-san, there’s something I want you to tell me.
Shouldn’t you ask your dad?
You okay with asking me?
Ask Mayuri.
No, I can’t ask Father.
You sure? I don’t know if I know anything he doesn’t.
You’re the only one I can ask.
What gift do you think would make my father happy?
I think he’d like anything you gave him.
That’s what everyone says. It’s always the exact same answer.
I’m honestly starting to wonder if you’re all plotting behind my back.
That’s because everyone respects you.
Huh.
Huh.
Uh.
Y-You too, Okabe-san?
Of course.
Yes.
That makes me happy!
Huh?
Yes, I think you can give me good advice.
I don’t want you expecting too much.
What kind of gift do you think a father would enjoy?
Your father, huh?
I think the darkness within him goes very deep...
Huh? The darkness?
Oh, uh.
Uh.
You know... dark... darkness... black... a black handkerchief?
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Maybe. Yeah.
A handkerchief.
Great! I’ll do that! But why black?
I think your dad probably likes black.
Thank you, Okabe-san!
I want a man’s opinion.
I see. So you’re coming to me.
Yes. What kind of things do men like?
What do you mean?!
???
What kind of gift would a man like?
Oh, I see.
My answer to that
is that it depends on the person, I guess.
I see.
Who are you giving it to?
My father?
I’ve never been a father,
so I can’t imagine what kind of things they’d want as a present from their daughter.
Uh.
Huh.
Err...
Okabe-san?
Hm?
What do you mean, “daughter?”
Oh.
Um.
No.
I mean...
Mayuri.
???
I was thinking about what Mayuri might do.
Sorry, I got you and Mayuri mixed up.
I know. A good gift from a son for his father is...
You know.
“Be strong!”
That’s the best present a son can give to his father.
!!
Okabe-san,
I understand! I’ll do twice as many practice swings with the Samidare.
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
Is Kagari-chan okay?
She’s fine. Don’t worry.
I’ll do something.
We’re all doing our best.
But...
I’m so, so worried.
You getting worried will just make things worse. Show her a smile.
Yeah.
This is harder for Kagari than any of us. We need to cheer her up!
You’re right! Thanks, Okarin!
Okay, Okarin. Thanks...
Yup. Just leave it to me.
That’s right. Daru-kun and Maho-san are helping. And so are you!
And we’ve got your help, too.
So it’ll be fine.
Yup! Mayushii will do her best!
Yeah. Keep it up.
Thanks, Okarin!
I’m worried about Kagari-san.
Believe in us.
We’ll do what we can.
Don’t worry. It’ll be fine.
Oh...
Right!
That’s right. I believe in you more than anyone, Okabe-san!
Of course, in Hashida-san and Maho-san, too!
If there’s anything I can do, let me know!
I’ll do anything!
I’ll let you know.
It bothers me that I can’t do anything.
It’s not much different for me.
Don’t say that.
You’re much stronger than me.
I’m not that great.
You always think I’m a lot better than I really am.
But thank you. I’ll do the best I can to live up to the person you think I am.
Thank you.
You really are strong.
Just hearing you say that makes me feel so much more relieved.
Thanks.
Leave it to me.
I’m out shopping with Luka-kun.
Do you want to come join us, Okabe-san?
Sorry, a bit busy now.
Where are you?
I’ll meet up later.
What happened?
I’m about to have a bit of a long talk.
With who?
Daru.
It’s not something we can let a girl hear.
I’m a guy, though.
I can’t let you hear it, Lukako. You’re too kind. It would knock you out cold.
Huh...
Okarin, don’t do anything too weird.
But you haven’t done anything like that lately, so it kind of feels like old times.
Sorry. Ask me another time.
No, sorry for bugging you.
Talk to you later.
Bye!
Farewell.
Right now? We’re in Ikebukuro.
I’m in Akihabara.
I see. Too bad.
Head straight home when you’re done shopping.
Why?
Because I say so.
I’ve got a bad feeling.
A premonition?
What happened?
Oh.
No, I mean the weather.
I think it might rain.
The skies are clear here.
Not a cloud in the sky!
It’s just my intuition.
Anyway, just head straight home after you’re done shopping.
Okay, got it.
Understood.
Really? Where are you now?
Akihabara.
Then should we meet you in Akihabara once we’re done shopping?
No, I’m heading home once I’m done. Meet me there.
Don’t come to Akihabara under any circumstances.
Why?
Because I say so.
Just wait for me.
But if I don’t contact you by evening, give up and go home. Got it?
What happened?
I’m fine. Don’t worry.
Okay, if you say so, Okarin!
We’ll wait until evening.
See you later, okay?
I guess Okabe-san’s busy.
Okarin?
Sorry, I can’t go today.
It’s fine. No problem.
You had something to do. It’s all right.
Having a lot of people around would just bother Hiyajo-san.
Really?
Huh? Why?
No. Please tell Maho-san I said hello.
Sure. Got it.
I hope I can see Maho-san before she leaves.
I’ll ask her how long she’s staying and contact you later.
Thank you!
I see. It wouldn’t be right to make her uncomfortable.
She’s staying in Tokyo for several days, right?
That’s what she said.
Then I’ll see her some other time.
Please do. I’m sure she’d love it.
Okay!
Congratulations
Sorry, there’s something I wanted to talk to you about. Can we meet?
It can be wherever is convenient for you.
It’s something that’s hard to say over RINE or the phone, so I’d like to meet in person if possible.
Sorry for being selfish like this. Is it okay?
Help
Someonesa fter me nearteh labrato
Sorry. I forgot all about yesterday.
I know it’s a bit late, but what’s up?
We found Shiina Kagari.
No way?! Where?!
A friend who works at a shrine was taking care of her. She was found on a mountain path near the Chiba border. But she’s lost her memories from before then.
She was that close?! Wow!
We’ve been looking for whoever is after her, but can’t find any info. It may be a pretty big group.
It would be a big help if you could keep it up.
Got here safe, nya!
In Ikebukuro!
Mayushii made it home fine!
No problems.
There’s something I want to ask you.
Got some time?
Kagari-san woke up. She’s calmed down.
Got it. Sorry, can you look after her for a while? I’ll contact you if I need you.
Just do it like we discussed.
Trick world,
linking each
possibility.
This is about my secret job, so let’s use this.
Secret job? You mean your hacking?
Yeah, basically.
It’s not all illegal stuff, though. I make online systems for manufacturers and banks, build and admin servers, boring things like that.
Oh, and I do virus analysis and make security software. There’s data recovery, oh, and making new encryption tech, too.
Seriously? So like a system engineer?
Nothing formal like that.
But we’ve got a bit of a reputation. Our group gets jobs from all over the world.
I call myself DaSH.
What’s that short for?
I can’t tell you.
Why?
I just can’t.
I don’t think I can help you with that.
You were close to Makise Kurisu, right?
Huh? What do you mean?
I want some help with her.
I’ve hit a dead end with this job I’m doing.
A job you’re doing? What do you mean?
Someone brought in a laptop and a portable hard drive to us a while back. Both of them have really strong full-disk encryption on them, and can’t be booted without a password. Of course, you can’t take the hard drive out and connect it to another PC, either.
The client hit up a bunch of places with no luck, and finally came to us.
Is the encryption that strong?
I’ve heard that even full-disk encryption can be broken by a pro.
Not happening with this one. You know why?
We were the ones who made it, baby.
Huh?
You guys made it? Then you can’t deal with it yourself?
I’m a believer that encryption needs to be a poison without an antidote or there’s no point.
So you don’t know how to break the code? Even though you made it?
Exactly.
If we can break it, then other hackers who are just as good as us can break it too, right? And that’s no good, duh.
I see.
And I swear, if you go “Epic super hacka work, bro,” I’ll end you! ヽ(`Д´)ノ
I wasn’t planning on it!
But what’s this got to do with Kurisu?
The laptop and hard drive belonged to
Makise Kurisu.
Something seemed weird about the client, so I hit up the PC manufacturer’s user registration database. How I did that is a secret, BTW.
And I found that it was registered under her name. Same address, too. It’s definitely her.
Who brought you the computer? Why would they have Kurisu’s computer?
Sorry. The rules say I can’t tell you that.
Were they Russian?
Huh? Nope. Why Russia? Nakabachi?
No, if it’s not, then fine.
So what do you want me to do?
I want a hint, man.
You know any words that Makise-shi might use for her password?
I can’t brute force the password, so I have to do it the hard way.
I’ve tried her birthday, graduation dates, and stuff. Address and phone, too. Not that I can imagine her picking them for a password.
Also any words commonly used in brain science, or frequently used in her papers. I’ve got all that data. Now I’m trying stuff from her private life.
So I figured I’d hit you up.
I want to talk in private. I’ll wait for you to contact me.
What’s wrong? Did something happen?
I’ll tell you in person.
Fine. Where do I go?
The top of the Radi-Kan.
I’m at the hospital visiting Nakase-san. It’ll be a while.
It’s fine. I’ll wait.
Roger.
You at the lab now?
Nope. At home playing H-games. What’s up?
I want to talk to you about your secret job.
Remember any info on Makise-shi?
Yeah.
What is it?
I’d like to talk in person. Can we meet at the lab?
Can it wait till evening?
You can play your H-games later, man.
Sorry. I lied about the H-games.
I’m actually busy at work.
Then where are you, really? If you can’t leave, then I’ll go to you. I need to talk right now.
I didn’t really want to tell you. I do a lot of dangerous jobs.
Well, whatever. Fine, I’ll tell you the location. Meet me here.
Tutturu♪! Where are you now?
Oh, the usual café, right?
I just went to your place and you weren’t home.
You did? Did my dad make a nuisance of himself again?
It’s okay. He gave me some barley tea.
I have to go shopping. Will you come with me?
Okay, I’ll leave now. Wait for me.
Okabe is in the basement of Tokyo Denki.
I just learned this now.
I followed their monitoring to find their location.
Take care of Okabe for me.
Teach that damn pervert of a professor what happens to peeping toms who watch me all the time.
Aw, come on, Okabe-kun! [linebreak] ><
There’s nobody in the Wako City office right now.
I’ve been behind you the whole time!
Sure, I may not stand out much, but seeing you look like you just ran into a ghost kind of hurts, you know?
Aw, I just explained this!
There was a gas leak at a lab yesterday.
The facility’s been locked down until they determine the cause.
Dr. Hiyajo and Professor Leskinen have moved their lab to Tokyo Denki University in the meantime.
There were so many people in the lobby that I didn’t think I could conduct a good interview. ><
Afterward, I called the front desk and then the police.
After the police got done with their questioning, Dr. Hiyajo still hadn’t calmed down, so I decided to message you and have her rest at the lab.
I can write articles anywhere, but I’m a bodyguard, so I need to stay by Dr. Hiyajo’s side!
You’re so far behind the times, Okabe-kun!
You can get most anything off the net in a day these days.
I asked Dr. Hiyajo what she wanted and ordered it off the net. ^^
Okabe-kun, that’s mine.
You can’t just go touching a girl’s underwear! [linebreak]><
It’s so convenient, having a fridge at work!
You don’t have to leave to go get drinks, so the only time you have to leave the room is to go to the bathroom! ><
I’m working on a special article for a business magazine at Arc Rewrite.
The special is on “The Front Lines of Artificial Intelligence Research.”
I’m supposed to write about Dr. Hiyajo. What she’s done and what she’s working on now.
I can find all that from the net, but that doesn’t make for a good article, you know?
So I thought maybe I could start with a long interview with Dr. Hiyajo.
Ask for me too! ><
I can pay, a little!
Sorry! >< Almost there! ><
No hurry. Take your time.
What’s up?
I see. So we can talk on the train like this.
It feels strange talking to you on RINE when we’re right next to each other.
You didn’t look like you were doing well. It may just have been my imagination.
Sorry to worry you! [linebreak](;;
It’s nothing.
Don’t worry about it.
I’ll make sure you get to Denki U., Dr. Hiyajo!
It’s weird being called Dr. Hiyajo.
It’s weird?
Yup.
You don’t have to call me doctor both in the real world and on RINE.
Let’s be a little more informal!
But then what do I call you?
Just call me by my name.
That’s what you do for Okabe-san, right?
That’s because he’s a student, and younger than me~! [linebreak](;;
You can treat me the same way.
We’ll be roommates for a while, and we’re both about the same age.
So how about we call each other Moeka and Maho?
Uuuhh... No way! ><
I’ve never called anyone by the first name-! [linebreak](;;
I’d be too nervous.
...Hmm.
Then how about Kiryu and Hiyajo?
Please be one of the few friends I’ve got in Japan.
Got it! Will do! [linebreak]><
OK!
Then try saying it now.
If we’re doing it, I want to start now.
But... but...! Like I just said, I’m really not good at talking to people-! ><
Really?
I thought you were just nervous because Okabe-san was with us last night.
Like you’re the kind of person who gets nervous around the opposite sex.
Hmm...
It’s true that when I talk to men I get even more nervous... ><
In other words, when it’s just girls, it’s not so bad that you can’t talk?
Well, maybe...
Then since we’re both girls, let’s get along!
I know. How about this?
When it’s just the two of us, how about we try to talk in person instead of RINE as much as we can?
I’d be less bored with someone to talk to.
If you’re going to be a writer for a magazine, I think it’d be a good chance to practice, don’t you?
Um...
...Okay! I’ll do my best!
It was fun talking with Sawayama today.
Tell me about Okabe-san next time.
I had fun, too.
I’ve said this before, but it’s not like that.
Disaster, nya!
The 314th Prophecy of Fatima has come to pass, nya!
The hearts of men have lost the will to believe, and the seal created by the sacrifice of the ancient Incan civilization has been broken, nya!
It’s only a matter of time before the dark god, the master of Pluto, revives, nya!
Not only the Earth, but the whole Galactic Federation is in danger, nya!
Summon the House of Lords and the Senate immediately, nya!
The President is missing, but I’m sure he’s flown off in Air Force 1 or something to fight the enemy himself, nya!
I’ll start the ceremony to seal him away once more, nya!
I want you to buy time for me until it finishes, nya!
Wait.
What are you talking about?
That was a joke, nya.
But really, there’s big trouble, nya!
What happened?
I’ll explain later, nya!
There’s a critical mission I want you to do before you head back to the condo, nya!
Kyouma
I mean Okarin!
Okarin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Big trouble, nya!
Tonight the 32,000 year cycle will complete, and planets shall align and the stars become right, nya!
The last seal will break, and He Who Waits Dreaming shall revive, and the lost continent of R’lyeh return, nya!
But anyway—
There really is trouble, nya!
I’m really, really sorry, but come to Faris’s house as soon as you can, nya!
Faris has to work all day today, so you’re the only one I can ask, nya!
You’ll know what I mean when you get here, nya!
Nya, and invite Mayushii, too! Make sure you do, nya!
It’s about time for takeoff.
You have to turn the phone off during takeoff.
But then you can’t see this, can you! I should’ve sent it earlier![linebreak]><
It wasn’t for a very long time, but I had so much fun with you!
Let’s see each other again some day! For sure!
I’ll send you lots of RINE messages, so send me lots back, okay?
All right, later!
Bye-bye! See you again, Maho! o(*[  ̑  ][  ̑  ]*)o
I think I’ve got a hint for Kagari’s memories.
There are some things I want to ask you. Where are you?
Go Go Curry
Big trouble! What do I do?
Mayuri-chan... I just happened to pass by her...
And she was running away crying!
I’ve never seen her so sad.
She was crying?! What happened?
I don’t know!
I just happened to run into her, so I said hi.
And she was crying.
I was really surprised, but when I asked what was going on she was really upset.
She said that it was her fault Kurisu-san had died, and that’s why you were suffering.
She said she should’ve died instead.
And then she ran away.
I ran after her but I lost her.
What do I do, Okabe-san?
What do I do?
Telling you this just in case. Kagari collapsed.
What do you mean?
Is she okay?
She’s awake now. She’s probably fine.
Suzuha, you got time after this?
I want to talk about what we do next.
Okey-dokey. I’ll go back to the lab.
I’ll head there, too.
You sure? It’s getting late.
I’m fine.
Thanks. See you there.
オカリン、オカリン、大変なんだよ〜?
オカリ〜〜ン、お〜い、オカリ〜〜〜〜ン、大変なんだよ〜!?
返事がないよ〜、がっかりなのです⋯⋯
なんだ、どうした?
こっちも大変なんだ。後でいいか?
すまない⋯⋯俺には無理だ
今ね、アキバの駅で有名なレイヤーさんと握手しちゃった♪
ほお、それは良かったな
うん♪ すっごくキレイだったよ〜
そっか⋯⋯オカリンも忙しいんだね⋯⋯
すまないな
いいよ、いいよ、じゃあまた後でね〜
まだ何も言ってないよ〜〜⋯⋯
ここからは秘密のバイト先の話になるんだ。だからこれで頼む
秘密のバイトって、お前の得意なハッキングかなんかだったよな?
まぁ、そんなとこ
つっても、非合法な仕事ばっかりじゃない。いろんなメーカーや銀行のオンラインシステムを組んだりとか、サーバーの構築や管理なんて地味な仕事もしてる
あと、ウィルスの解析をしてセキュリティソフトを作ったりもするし、重要なデータの復旧とか新しい暗号化技術の開発とかもね
マジか⋯⋯SEってやつか
そこまでちゃんとしたものじゃない
でもいちおう業界では有名でさ、世界中から依頼が来るグループなのだぜ
僕は『DaSH』って名乗ってる
なんの略だ?
それは言えねえ
なんで?
とにかく言えねえ
俺がお前のそういう仕事の力になれるとは思えないけどな?
オカリンって、牧瀬紅莉栖と親しかったんだよね?
え? どういうことだ?
牧瀬氏に関することでアドバイスが欲しいんだ
今、僕が担当してる仕事で行き詰まっててさ
担当してる仕事? なんだそれ?
つい最近、バイト先にノートPCとポータブルハードディスクが持ち込まれたんだ。両方とも強固なフルディスク暗号化が施されてて、鍵になってるパスワードがないと起動できない状態になってる。もちろん、中のハードディスクを取り出して別のPCなんかにつないでも復号化は不可能
クライアントはいろんな会社に相談したらしいんだけど、どこもさじを投げてさ。僕らの所を紹介されて来たっつーワケ
そんなにすごい暗号なのか?
フルディスク暗号化といっても、結局、その道のプロなら鍵を外せるって聞いたことがあるが
こいつに関しては絶対に無理。なぜかっていうと
この暗号化ソフトを作ったのは僕らだから([キリ][ッ]
は?
お前たちが作った? それなら、自分でなんとか出来るんじゃないのか?
暗号化に関しては、解毒剤の作れない毒じゃなきゃ意味がないと僕は考えてるんだお
つまり解き方が分からない? 自分で作ったのに?
Exactly
僕らになんとか出来るってことは、僕らと同レベルのハッカーにもなんとか出来ちゃうってことじゃん? それじゃ駄目だろ常考
なるほど
スーパーハカー乙とか言うな!ヽ(`Д´)ノ
言ってないだろ!
けど、それと紅莉栖になんの関係が?
ノートPCとハードディスクの所有者が、
牧瀬紅莉栖
クライアントに腑に落ちない点があったんで、PCメーカーのユーザー登録データにアクセスしてみた。どうやってアクセスしたかは秘密な
そしたら登録者が牧瀬氏の名前だったんだよね。住所なんかも確認済み。本人に間違いない
お前のところにPCを持ち込んだクライアントってのは誰なんだ? なんで紅莉栖のPCを?
スマソ。それは話せないルールなんで
ロシア人か?
は? 違うけど。なんでロシア? 中鉢関係?
いや、違うならいい
それで、俺はなにをすればいい?
ヒントが欲しいんだよね
牧瀬氏がパスワードに使いそうな言葉とか知らん?
強引に復号化するのは無理。となると、あとは地道に攻めるしかないんで
牧瀬氏にまつわる記念日とか、住所や電話番号なんてのは全部調べた。まぁ、そんな簡単なパスワードを使うとは思えんけどね
他には、脳科学によくある単語とか、発表した論文で頻繁に使ってるワードとか、そういったデータも収集済み。今はプライベートに関するワードを集めてるとこ
だからオカリンにも聞いてみようと思ったんだ
