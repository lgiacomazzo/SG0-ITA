[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
I wet a towel at the sink, and put it on Kagari’s forehead as she lay on the sofa.[%p]
She looked like she was having a nightmare.[%p]
Her breathing was shallow and pained.[%p]
She still wasn’t awake.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You think she’s okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know...”[%p]
She’d just collapsed out of nowhere, after all.[%p]
It had been about five minutes ago when she’d arrived, and then immediately collapsed.[%p]
Daru and Mayuri and I had somehow managed to get her over to the sofa.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, isn’t putting a wet towel on someone’s forehead what you do when they’ve got a high fever?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She doesn’t look like she’s got a fever at all.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Does this work on people who’ve just passed out?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not like we’ve got a better option. I don’t know of any other things we can do.”[%p]
Neither Daru nor I had the knowledge required to handle this situation.[%p]
But since Kagari had no insurance card and no residency certificate, taking her to a hospital felt like a bad idea.[%p]
All we could do was wait for her to wake up.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...Mommy.”[%p]
I heard her whisper something.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She just said ‘Mommy’!”[%p]
We both put our ears closer to her mouth.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Don’t go...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mommy!”[%p]
She suddenly jerked upward.[%p]
The two of us just barely managed to avoid getting a headbutt.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Th-That was close...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-Wait, no! I missed my chance to do something naughty to Kagari-tan and not get blamed for it!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Stupid! I’m so stupid!”[%p]
I ignored Daru, who was bashing his head against the floor in frustration, and spoke to Kagari.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You okay?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okabe...san?”[%p]
Kagari seemed confused, and it took her a moment to realize that she was lying on the sofa.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh? Was I asleep? Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t remember?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You saw Mayu-shi the minute you got here, then fainted.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“When I looked at Mayuri-san?”[%p]
I realized that her tone had changed since the worldline switch.[%p]
More precisely, it had switched. It was back to how it was when I first met her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You seemed to know the song she was singing.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The song...?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...Oh!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s right! That song! I know that song!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’ve heard it somewhere! A long, long time ago! When I was a little kid!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ooh, FTW! This is totally a sign that her memories are gonna come back!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Where’s Mayuri-san? Where’d she go?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I have to get her to tell me about that song.”[%p]
Her eyes darted around the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She had to go to work at MayQueen, so she left as soon as you got here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She was really worried about you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m really sorry.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They asked me to come in for the lunch shift today, and I really can’t miss it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Daru-kun, take care of Kagari-san for me, okay?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I see...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is there anything else you remembered?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t matter how small.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Anything else...”[%p]
She put her hand up to her forehead so she could think.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
But then she shook it, softly.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...No.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t remember anything else.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I know that I’ve heard that song before, but I can’t remember who I heard it from at all...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Did you dream at all when you were passed out just now, Kagari-tan?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Dream?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, you looked like you were having a bad dream. You kept saying ‘Mommy.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, you yelled that when you woke up, too.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I did...?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I wondered if that song might’ve been the key to bringing back some of your memories or something.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Well...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...No, I can’t remember anything.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I think I was dreaming, yes.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And that dream was very important...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry for causing all this trouble.”[%p]
But both Daru and I knew this was a big step forward.[%p]
She knew the song that Mayuri was singing.[%p]
And she said she’d learned it when she was a child.[%p]
That would have been in the future, before she’d gotten in the time machine.[%p]
Which meant that there could only be one answer.[%p]
It was the future Mayuri who’d taught Kagari that song.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, you think asking Mayu-shi would be a good first step?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right. She said she only had to work the lunch shift, so let’s head over to MayQueen when it’s winding down.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I-I’ll go, too!”[%p]
Kagari quickly stood up off the sofa.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down. We’re not leaving right away. You should rest a little.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, um... you’re right.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sorry.”[%p]
And then her stomach rumbled.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uh...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You hungry? We’ve got instant ramen.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And Mayu-shi’s chicken and bananas, too.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’d like a banana.”[%p]
She seemed embarrassed.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Welcome back, myaster!”[%p]
When we opened the door to MayQueen+Nyan², the usual cat-eared maid was there to welcome us.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh, Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kagari-nyan, too! Welcome back!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hello, Faris-san.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hmmya... Okarin, every time you’ve been here lately, it’s been with a different girl.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So it’s true what they say, that you’ve mastered the aura of a popular college boy, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m here to see Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I figured she’d be about done with her shift.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“She was working in the kitchen today, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The kitchen...!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We didn’t have enough maids fur lunchtime today.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So we had her come in to help, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-Hey, is it really okay to let her cook?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“She really wanted to cook, but we had her focus on washing plates, nya.”[%p]
That was Faris for you. She knew exactly who belonged where.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I told her she could go home, so she should be changing right now, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tell her we’re waiting outside, then.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Roger, nya!”[%p]
We waited down below for a bit before Mayuri came out.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Kagari-san!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Thanks for coming to get me!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Is Kagari-san okay?”[%p]
As soon as she got out of the store, Mayuri ran out and gave Kagari a big hug. She had a worried look on her face as she peered into Kagari’s eyes.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Thanks, Mayuri-san. Yeah, I’m okay now.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m so glad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You just fell over, so I was really worried!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry I worried you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But why did you two come to get me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There was something I wanted to ask you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“About that song you were just singing.”[%p]
I repeated the conversation I had at the lab for Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So can you tell us where you heard that song?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... Mayushii heard Suzu-san singing it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha was singing it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“After work, Mayushii studies a lot at the lab.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“On rainy days, Suzu-san does her training inside. Like pushups and situps and stuff.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And when she finishes her training, she always takes a shower.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“After she comes out, she looks out the window at the rain as she dries her hair.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And when she does, she always softly sings this song.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ve never asked her what it’s called, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
So maybe it was a song from the future, then.[%p]
Like a song that was popular with people in the 2030s, maybe?[%p]
Maybe Kagari learned it at the same time that Suzuha did.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So maybe we should ask Suzuha next.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve come this far, so I’ll stay with you until we find out.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Really? Thank you!”[%p]
My relationship with Suzuha was probably still pretty strained in this world, but she would probably help me get Kagari’s memories back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s head back to the lab. She should be working at the Braun Tube Workshop.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii will go with you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You’re sure, Mayuri-san?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup!”[%p]
Mayuri gave a cheerful answer, and then started to fidget as if she were embarrassed for some reason.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... um... I don’t know how to say this, but...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When I see you, Kagari-san, I feel like I have to do something.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s like I want to protect you, or I want to help you...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wonder why! It’s strange, isn’t it? Ehehe!”[%p]
Maybe it was the bond between mother and daughter.[%p]
It was going to be a long time before Mayuri became Kagari’s mother, though.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And also...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think it’s sad, not being able to remember things.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mayuri-san...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s fine! Let’s all do our best!”[%p]
And so the three of us went back to the lab.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? Suzu-san’s bike isn’t here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s strange. It was here when we left.”[%p]
Just as we went to peek inside the Braun Tube Workshop, Tennouji came out.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, you need something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um, is Suzuha here? I think she was working a while ago...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Oh, she left for the day.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She said she had something to do this afternoon. Seemed pretty serious.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you ask what it was?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Nope. I’m not interested in getting involved in my part-timers’ private lives.”[%p]
That was all he said before he headed back into the shop.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wonder where she went.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What do you suppose she had to do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I hoped it was nothing serious.[%p]
I’ll try RINE.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Go Go Curry?”[%p]
Was she eating a late lunch?[%p]
Was that... important?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s go check it out.”[%p]
[name]GO GO CURRY clerk[line]“Wow, that was amazing!”[%p]
[name]GO GO CURRY clerk[line]“The winner of this month’s Go Go Curry Akihabara eating contest is—”[%p]
[name]GO GO CURRY clerk[line]“The first person in store history to win three in a row! The Silent Slaughterer!”[%p]
[name]Gallery[line]“Wow...! Where does she fit all that curry into her tiny body?”[%p]
[name]Gallery[line]“She’s the Goddess of Curry! The Goddess of Curry has appeared before us!”[%p]
[name]Gallery[line]“She sure slaughtered that curry! If you told me she was a real assassin, I’d believe it!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]GO GO CURRY clerk[line]“Congratulations to our winner, the Silent Slaughterer!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Wow.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow...”[%p]
Was this what Suzuha had been up to?[%p]
The store had said she’d won three times in a row, and the customers seemed to know her. Did that mean she was a regular?[%p]
Suzuha made her way over to us through the cheering crowds.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Whew.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? What’s wrong, you three?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry. The tournament was just about to begin, so I didn’t have time to type out a longer response.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow. I can’t believe you ate that big plate of curry!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Eat what you can, when you can. You need that nutrition to survive on the battlefield.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Th-The battlefield?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um... Did I hear that wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s probably better not to think about it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So, Uncle, what was this about a clue to Kagari’s memories?”[%p]
I explained what had happened so far.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? You heard me singing?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You should’ve said something, Big Sis Mayu.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You were so cute when you were singing. I thought if I said something, you’d stop.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re so mean.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, where did you hear that song?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Mom. Mom used to sing it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yuki-san did?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh? Yuki-san?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Your mom’s name is Yuki-san, too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Suzuha[line]“Oops.”[linebreak][parallel]“Oops.”[%p]
Oops![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not it! Yuki-san’s nickname is ‘Mom’”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Th-That’s right! I just always call her that.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uh... do you? So how did she get that nickname—”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry, we can talk about that some other time!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, over here!”[%p]
Suzuha and I stood a little away from Kagari.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Listen, is there really any point in hiding the truth about Mom from her?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Her memories might not come back, so it’s smarter not to tell her, I think.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I see...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’d like to avoid that, if we can.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So Yuki-san taught you that song in the future, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Of course.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“She used to sing it as she cooked, so I learned it that way.”[%p]
I was getting confused.[%p]
So what was going on here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So when Kagari was little, she learned it from you or Yuki-san?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No way.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kagari only became Big Sis Mayu’s adopted daughter after Mom died.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And I’ve never sung it for anyone. I’ve never let Kagari hear it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It was all I could do to survive back then. I didn’t have time to sing.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I didn’t even realize that I’d been singing it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“She said she learned it when she was a kid, so she probably learned it from Big Sis Mayu.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
Which meant Kagari learned it from Mayuri, who learned it from hearing Suzuha hum it. And Suzuha learned it from Yuki, her mother.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which means next we visit Yuki-san, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is turning into a game of telephone.”[%p]
But even so, if we kept at it, we were sure to learn the truth eventually.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve got to do maintenance on the time machine, so I don’t think I can go.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Take care of Kagari for me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So that’s the story.”[%p]
I explained to Mayuri and Kagari what I’d learned from Suzuha.[%p]
Of course, since I couldn’t tell them about the future, I skirted around that part of the story.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I see. So next it’s Yuki-san, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, can you contact her for me?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay, sure.”[%p]
Mayuri took out her phone to call Yuki.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She’s not answering.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ll send her a RINE.”[%p]
Mayuri gave up on calling her and sent her a message on RINE.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There we go.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry this turned into such a big deal.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t worry about it!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And you know, Mayushii is having fun going on a walk with Kagari-san.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I feel kind of relaxed, too, talking with you like this.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, me too!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Maybe we just get along.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe... That makes me happy!”[%p]
If Daru was here, he’d yell, “Yuri FTW!”[%p]
Come to think of it, Daru had said he’d had something to do today, and I hadn’t seen him since we’d left the lab. It was probably something I didn’t want to know about.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, I just got a message from Yuki-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“‘I’m actually on a date with Hashida-san,’ it says.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, I see!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“They’re dating?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I hadn’t heard that they were close enough to start dating.”[%p]
Was that what Daru was up to?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm... Looks like she’s coming to the lab this evening.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Evening, huh? That’s not for a little while.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t think we should interrupt their date, though.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s right. Let’s wait.”[%p]
If Kagari wanted to wait, it wasn’t my place to disagree.[%p]
We decided to have Mayuri answer Yuki’s message and then go back to the lab.[%p]
On the way—[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Aah!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm? What’s up?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Over there!”[%p]
Mayuri suddenly lowered her voice and quietly pointed toward a nearby cafeteria with outdoor seating.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah...!”[%p]
Two people we recognized were sitting at one of the tables.[%p]
It was Yuki and Daru.[%p]
The two of them were eating a sandwich together![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is... I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I guess since Daru’s over there, and not here, I’ll say it for him.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, normies must explode!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“W-What do we do?!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We shouldn’t get in the way...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But this isn’t something you get to see every day, is it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s... very true!”[%p]
Mayuri’s eyes were filled with passion. She seemed to be truly cheering them on.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Should we wait for them to finish and pretend we just happened to walk by?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii thinks that’s a great idea!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sounds good to me!”[%p]
Kagari and Mayuri were getting excited.[%p]
Was this really that exciting?[%p]
We sat at a nearby table in the corner of the terrace so as not to let them see us.[%p]
We covered our faces as best we could and quietly observed the two of them.[%p]
They seemed to be enjoying their lunch.[%p]
I could just barely make out what they were saying.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Aw, Hashida-san. You’ve got some tomato stuck on your mouth. I’ll wipe it off.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“N-N-N-No-no-no. I’m fine. Just fine. I-I-I-I’ll wipe it off myself.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But you never have a handkerchief with you, do you? Come on, turn this way.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I-I-I-If any of my bodily fluids get on your handkerchief, y-y-you’ll have to throw it out...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I will not.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Come on, here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Aaah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is he doing?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They’re getting along so well! I’m jealous.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“They make a perfect couple.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do they?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri & Kagari[line]“They do!”[linebreak][parallel]“Of course they do!”[%p]
... I don’t get it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They look so happy together. That’s so nice...”[%p]
Mayuri was watching them with stars in her eyes.[%p]
And then—[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aah...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mayuri-san, are you hungry?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe... I was going to eat after work.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, were you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Okay, I’ll order something. My treat.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re sure?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s my way of saying thanks for helping.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yay! You’re so nice, Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay... Okay...”[%p]
Mayuri’s eyes shone as she looked at the menu.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I want crepes! With lots of strawberries and cream!”[%p]
Evidently the place was offering a special on crepes today.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Okay. What about you, Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I just ate, so...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, let’s eat together!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Thanks... I’ll have the banana and chocolate one, then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Roger.”[%p]
I went to buy crepes, being careful not to let Daru and Yuki see me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mmm!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mmm!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“These are so good! I can’t believe it!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Right? The chocolate has just the right amount of bitterness!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And the strawberries are good, too!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Here, Kagari-san. Say, ‘Aah!’”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Aaah!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mm, it’s good.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wait, what are you making me do?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aw, come on. You don’t need to get embarrassed. We’re both girls.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s true, but...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, you’ve got some cream on your cheek.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, oops!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii will get it off for you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I-I’m okay! I can do it by myself!”[%p]
Kagari hurriedly took a hand mirror and handkerchief out of her pouch and wiped it off.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aw, Mayushii wanted to do that.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Come on, Mayuri-san. You can’t do that.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? Why?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why? Because...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“When you say stuff like that, it makes me feel weird.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Weird?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It makes me really want to let you spoil me...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It’s strange. I’m supposed to be older than you.”[%p]
Kagari’s cheeks flushed red as she stared up into Mayuri’s eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe... That means you love me, right?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What?!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii loves you, too!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um, Mayuri-san? I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, she doesn’t really mean anything by it. Don’t let it bug you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“S-She doesn’t?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, hey, give Mayushii a bite too, okay? Aaah!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aaah!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, fine. Here, say, ‘Aah.’”[%p]
Mayuri took a bite of the crepe in Kagari’s hand.[%p]
To someone else’s eyes, it must’ve just looked like two sisters feeding each other crepes. Of course, Mayuri would be the little sister.[%p]
But it didn’t look that way to me.[%p]
It looked like a little Kagari was blushing and stretching a hand out toward her mother.[%p]
I really did want to get her memories back.[%p]
I could only imagine what the future was like after World War Three occurred.[%p]
But no matter how bad it got, families still must have gotten together to eat dinner.[%p]
Maybe this happened in the future, too...[%p]
That would be a very happy—[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s wrong? You’re spacing out.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, sorry. I was thinking about something...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you want a crepe, too?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why not go get one?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine. I just ate.”[%p]
And the crepes looked so sweet that I’d lost my appetite.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, I know!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii will give you a bite of hers, then. Aah!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You can have one of mine, too! Aah!”[%p]
I suddenly found myself with two smiling girls shoving two crepes in my face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“C-Come on, stop that! It’s embarrassing!”[%p]
Without even thinking, I tried to move my chair back, only to get it caught on the leg of the table.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah—”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okabe-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“O-Ow...”[%p]
The rest of the café watched me as I fell flat onto the ground. I ended up attracting a lot of attention.[%p]
And as a result—[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Is that you, Okabe-san?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wha—?! O-O-O-Okarin, what are you doing here?”[%p]
...They found us.[%p]
We explained to the two of them how we’d found ourselves here.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Jeez! You should’ve said something!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe... Sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“We didn’t want to interrupt.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“It’s embarrassing to think that you’ve been watching us the whole time.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Daru’s face was as placid as a sage’s.[%p]
Knowing that we saw him like that must have snapped his mind in half.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, Yuki-san, how about it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you remember where you heard that song?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I do. It was really recent.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I work at a dessert cooking class. I’m the teacher’s assistant.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You know how I love to make snacks, right? I’m still learning, though.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“All her desserts are really yummy!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I see!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Let’s make some soon, Kagari-san. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yes, please!”[%p]
I tried to get the conversation back on track.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, what’s the deal with the song and this class?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Oh, right.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“One of the students in the class is always singing it.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I don’t think she knows she’s doing it, but she always looks really happy when she does.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I picked it up at some point.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that student someone you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Someone I know?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hmm... I don’t think so. She’s an older woman.”[%p]
...We’d played the game of telephone to this point, and ended up with someone who had nothing to do with any of us.[%p]
Maybe it was a really common song and Kagari had just happened to learn it from hearing someone sing it in the future...[%p]
No, it was too early to assume that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s try getting a hold of that student.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yuki-san, can you contact her for us?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know you can’t tell us her private information.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I don’t mind. It’s a class, sure, but it’s not that big of a deal.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I know her email. I talk to her all the time.”[%p]
Yuki took her phone out of her pouch and started to fiddle with it. She seemed to be looking at a list of addresses.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um... Oh, here we go. This is her.”[%p]
She turned the phone toward us.[%p]
Seeing the name of a person we’d never met wouldn’t do us any good, but we looked anyway.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Mayuri[line]“HUH?!”[linebreak][parallel]“HUH?!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? What?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Th-That name...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s Okarin’s mom!”[%p]
There was no doubt about it.[%p]
That was my mom’s name.[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“Wow, so Yuki-san’s a friend of yours!”[%p]
After hearing the shocking news that Kagari’s song traced its roots all the way back to my mom, we went back to the lab.[%p]
It would’ve been embarrassing to call my mom in front of Mayuri and Kagari.[%p]
So I went out up to the roof, in the cold, to call home.[%p]
When I asked my mom if she was going to a cooking class, she seemed surprised that I didn’t know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“I see... That song, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“I had no idea I was singing it. That’s kind of embarrassing. Ahaha!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’d you learn that song?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“Where?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like you heard it on the radio? Or maybe you heard someone else singing it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“It was you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“You used to sing it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha-”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha-wha-wha-what?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about? That’s impossible!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“You remember when you were in middle school and Mayuri-chan got really depressed, right? When her grandma died.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“Everybody was really worried, but one day she suddenly got better.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“But then you started going crazy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“What was all that about? You were a... bad scientist?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Please stop.”[%p]
Was there anything in the world more terrifying than hearing about your own Dark Past from your mom?[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“When you started being a bad whatsits, you would sing that song whenever you took a bath.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“You sang it so often I guess I learned it. Ahaha!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I sang it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“That’s right! You don’t remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro’s Mother[line]“Oh, a customer’s here. Bye! It’s going to rain soon, so come home quick.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Seriously?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, Okarin, how’d it go?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Did you find anything out?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I explained what I’d heard from my mom, even though I didn’t really understand it myself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri & Kagari[line]“What?!”[linebreak][parallel]“What?!”[%p]
Yeah, they were surprised.[%p]
I was more surprised than anybody.[%p]
I was so surprised that I was actually feeling pretty calm.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“So... what does this all mean?”[%p]
...[%p]
What did it mean?[%p]
Kagari had learned the song from Mayuri in the future.[%p]
Mayuri had learned it in the present from Suzuha.[%p]
Suzuha had learned it from Yuki in the future.[%p]
Yuki had learned it from my mom.[%p]
And my mom had learned it from me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did I ever... sing?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm... Mayushii doesn’t remember.”[%p]
If it was a popular song, maybe I would’ve hummed it, but...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No luck. I can’t remember.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What do we do? We’re out of clues, aren’t we?”[%p]
Mayuri looked like she was about to cry. Kagari gave her a gentle hug.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Please calm down, Mayuri-san.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okabe-san, does the fact that you sang it when Mayuri-san was depressed give you any kind of clue?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know... I didn’t really do anything special.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All I did was go see Mayuri when she was visiting her grandmother’s grave.”[%p]
That was when Hououin Kyouma, now sealed away, had been born.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Should we go to her grave, then?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You might remember something.”[%p]
Was that possible?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“After all this, I want to see this through to the end.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin. Mayushii wants you to do it, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Okay. Let’s go.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Thank you!”[%p]
The sun was about to set, so we decided to go the next day.[%p]
