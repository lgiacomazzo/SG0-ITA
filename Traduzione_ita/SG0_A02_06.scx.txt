Urushibara Luka was sad.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He’d been sad for a long, long time.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It had been a long time since he’d met Okabe Rintaro, become friends, and began to visit the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici.[%p]
Hashida Itaru, his classmate Shiina Mayuri, and the other lab members all treated him as a friend.[%e]
That by itself made him happy.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He was just an ordinary, shy boy, and they accepted him anyway. He was very grateful for that.[%p]
But still, he’d always felt like he was being left out.[%e]
He knew they were hiding something from him.[%p]
That made him sad.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But what made him sadder was that he couldn’t bring himself to ask them about it.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re not going to sleep?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What about you, Amane-san? I didn’t think you’d still be awake.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve got a lot to think about.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I see...”[%p]
Even Luka could tell that “a lot” meant she was thinking about what happened today.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The New Year’s party.[%p]
The mysterious men who’d burst into the lab...[%p]
They were holding guns.[%e]
Not modelli in plastica a forma di armi.[%p]
Real guns.[%p]
[margin top="38"]From Luka’s perspective, it was a mystery how they’d even gotten them into Japan.[%p]
But they were real anyway.[%e]
They’d had real guns in their hands, and they’d pointed them at him and the others.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It hadn’t seemed real then, but now the very thought made him shiver.[%p]
If any of them had squeezed their index fingers just a little, he—Luka—wouldn’t be here right now.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
Shiina Kagari moaned softly in her sleep.[%p]
She must’ve been really tired after everything that had happened today.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She had gone to sleep almost immediately after she’d laid down.[%p]
And her short breaths had soon changed into moans.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma... Mamma... don’t go... Mamma...”[%p]
Was she dreaming of her mother?[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma... Mamma Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Even that didn’t surprise Luka much.[%p]
She’d started calling out that name in her sleep several days ago.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Shiina Kagari.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Shiina Mayuri.[%p]
[margin top="38"]At first, he just thought it was a coincidence that they had the same last name.[%p]
But—[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“Aah...”[%p]
He almost spoke, then stopped.[%p]
There was so much he wanted to ask, but couldn’t.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He wanted courage.[%p]
Just a little.[%p]
The courage to ask them to tell him.[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
He reached under his pillow and felt something hard.[%p]
It was a cheap toy sword, the kind you could buy at any store.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But still, it was his treasure.[%p]
He held the hilt tight.[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“U-Um...!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“C-Can I ask you something?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Che c’è?”[%p]
Suzuha sat up and looked straight at him.[%p]
He was only barely able to stop himself from looking away.[%p]
If he did, he wouldn’t be able to ask anything.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He touched the toy sword once more, and slowly opened his mouth to speak.[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“A-Amane-san... Why do you call Okabe-san ‘Uncle Okarin’?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why do you call Mayuri-chan ‘Big Sis Mayu’? Why do you call Faris-san ‘Big Sis Rumi’?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why do you call me ‘Brother Luka’?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“When she says ‘Mamma Mayuri,’ she’s talking about Mayuri-chan, isn’t she? Why does she call her that?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I know I shouldn’t be saying this, but I think it’s better that you don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Are you just trying to keep me out of everything again?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I want to know what’s going on, too. I want to share in what all of you are going through.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Brother Luka...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Will you tell me?”[%p]
She looked him straight in the eye for a moment, silently.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Luka simply waited.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think I understand the reason why Uncle Okarin doesn’t tell you anything.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The reason why?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He wants you to stay completely a part of this world.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He wants you to be the one person who only knows the world as it is right now.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think that’s what saves him.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m what saves him?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sì...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But that’s...”[%p]
Now that she’d told him that...[%p]
He couldn’t ask any more questions.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Did Okabe Rintaro really think that?[%p]
He didn’t even know.[%p]
[margin top="38"]In the end, he would never know anything.[%p]
And that only made him sadder.[%e]
