[name]Rintaro[line]“Wow...”[%p]
That was all I could say as I watched these tough men go down, one after the other.[%p]
I knew from his size that Tennouji was strong. It was the other girl that really shocked me.[%p]
Her disguise ruined, Suzuha jumped around like a cat. Each time she moved, the men around her quivered.[%p]
I knew she’d undergone combat training, but I had no idea she was this strong when she was serious.[%p]
The kicks from her long, lithe legs were like a work of art.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“—!”[%p]
[name]Man[line]“Gaah!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Not bad, part-timer.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You too, boss.”[%p]
The men fell to the ground without even having the time to draw their knives and guns.[%p]
Several days earlier—[%p]
When I realized that the enemy was probably starting to panic, I came up with a plan.[%p]
In the last linea di universo, Moeka had told me that someone was looking for Kagari.[%p]
I wondered if that was true in this linea di universo, too—[%p]
So I asked Moeka to leak some information for me.[%p]
A girl matching Shiina Kagari’s description came down this road at the same time every day.[%p]
And today, a few days later, they’d all abboccato all’amo.[%p]
I hung back behind the corner of an alley, watching them fight. I felt kind of pathetic.[%p]
But it was obvious that not only would I be of no help whatsoever, I’d actually just get in the way.[%p]
So it was smarter to leave it to them.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How are things on your side?”[%p]
I heard Daru’s voice from the earphone on one of my ears.[%p]
I’d called him and left the call connected so we could talk at any time.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is Suzuha ok? Is she hurt?”[%p]
Daru had been opposed to Suzuha’s plan to use herself as a decoy.[%p]
He must’ve been worried about putting his daughter in danger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. She’s a lot more amazing than you realize.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, she is my daughter. But if she gets hurt, I’m going to hate you forever, Okarin.”[%p]
He’d be better off worrying about the people she was fighting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“?!”[%p]
I suddenly heard a high-pitched whistle.[%p]
At the signal, the men started to turn and run.[%p]
They’d realized they’d fallen into a trap and decided to retreat.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Sorry, not happening.”[%p]
Tennouji’s giant arms grabbed one of the men’s hands.[%p]
Ma—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
There was a hollow popping sound, and the man’s body went limp.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Tch—!”[%p]
No way...[%p]
He was dead?[%p]
He took his own life?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle! He’s coming toward you!”[%p]
A piercing yell brought me back to my senses.[%p]
One of the men was coming toward the alleyway where I was hiding.[%p]
Our goal was to capture them and make them tell us who they were working for.[%p]
If we couldn’t do that, all of this would be for nothing![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
I ran out in front of the man without even thinking.[%p]
[name]Man[line]“—?!”[%p]
My sudden appearance caused him to hesitate for a moment.[%p]
But he kept charging without dropping his speed.[%p]
I saw that he was holding on to something shiny near his waist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Grr—!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Haaahh!”[%p]
Just as he hit me, Suzuha slammed into him with a jump kick.[%p]
[name]Man[line]“Gwah!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Gotcha!”[%p]
The kick knocked him directly into Tennouji’s waiting arms.[%p]
Tennouji caught him easily, then spun the man’s arms around his back so he couldn’t hurt himself.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, are you hurt?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are you ok?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I-I’m fine...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin! What’s wrong?! What happened?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. Everyone’s safe. Suzuha, did we get him?”[%p]
[name]Man[line]“Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!”[%p]
Something like a scream came out of his mouth.[%p]
At some point, Tennouji had jammed what looked like a towel into it.[%p]
He was probably trying to keep him from killing himself, like the last guy.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, cool it. You’re the one who’s gonna have a bad time if there’s a fuss.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“And we’re still only on the first one, pussy. We’ve got 9 more to go.”[%p]
[name]Man[line]“Mmffmm... mffmm...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Then we’ve got the eyes. Then both ears. The nose... There’s lots of fun in store for you.”[%p]
His voice was cold.[%p]
This was the real Tennouji. This was FB.[%p]
I wanted to look away, but Suzuha was watching without flinching in the slightest.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I don’t want to spend a lot of time on this, either. You’re going to tell me in the end, anyway, so isn’t it better to just get it over with now?”[%p]
[name]Man[line]“Mmmmmmmm!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hmm? Well? Shall we go for number two?”[%p]
[name]Man[line]“Mmm! Mmm!”[%p]
The man shook his head violently.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Should’ve just done that to start with. So, who are you working for?”[%p]
[name]Man[line]“...”[%p]
Tennouji took the towel out of the man’s mouth. He said something in a whisper so small I couldn’t hear it.[%p]
Tennouji’s pallor suddenly changed.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...Stratfo?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, you’re not lying to me, are you?”[%p]
The man desperately shook his head again.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Stratfo, huh? That’s going to be a problem...”[%p]
Stratfo...[%p]
I’d heard of them.[%p]
Back when I was into teorie del complotto, I’d looked them up on the internet.[%p]
Their real name was “Strategic Focus,” I think.[%p]
They were an American civilian intelligence company, sometimes called the Shadow [color index="280AA02D1400"]CIA[color index="800000"].[%p]
They specialized in military matters, and their skills had supposedly been put to good use during the Iraq and Gulf Wars.[%p]
If a SERN Rounder like Tennouji said they were a problem, they probably were.[%p]
This wasn’t going to be easy.[%p]
But... now wasn’t a time for being scared.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You hear that, Daru? Start hacking Stratfo’s servers right now!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
I felt myself starting to relax after I completed my first objective.[%p]
But there wasn’t time for that.[%p]
This was where things really began.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What’s wrong, boss? Something bothering you?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Nah. It’s just that Stratfo’s a civilian company, you know?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“That means somebody’s hiring them. No matter how many of these people you catch, is it really going to solve the problem?”[%p]
It did seem strange, come to think of it.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, you. Are you really—”[%p]
Tennouji tried to wring the man’s neck again, but-[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Damn it! He passed out. What a wimp.”[%p]
Tennouji sighed and took out a rope, then started to tie him up.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Let me clean this up. You guys go.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re sure?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“This isn’t the end, is it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I was a little curious what he intended to do with them, but...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...All right. We’ll let you take care of it!”[%p]
I had other priorities right now.[%p]
I said my thanks to Tennouji and hurried to the lab with Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, hurry!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I-I know!”[%p]
Suzuha ran through the night like a panther. It was all I could do to keep up.[%p]
The path to the lab seemed far longer than it usually did.[%p]
We finally made it to the lab.[%p]
Mayuri, Faris, and everyone else were already there waiting.[%p]
And Kagari, too...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hahh... hahh...”[%p]
Kagari was lying on the couch in obvious pain.[%p]
Her breathing was shallow.[%p]
Her complexion was pale.[%p]
Something bad could happen to her at any moment.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru... How’s it going?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Just a sec. I’ve got the route I used the last time I hacked it. Checking it now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The last time... Why did you do something so dangerous?!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It was a bet with a buddy of mine. We were going to try and see who could hack it faster. Winner got a year’s worth of [color index="280AA02D1400"]Go Go Curry[color index="800000"].”[%p]
He probably had no idea how dangerous that was...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? You’re not going to ask who won?”[%p]
From the way he was acting, there was no need to even ask.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just hurry.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Roger.”[%p]
Since their plan to steal back Kagari had failed, there was a good chance Stratfo would resort to even more desperate measures.[%p]
There was no time to waste.[%p]
E—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? You’re not looking so good.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s nothing.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s not nothing, nya. Let me see, nya.”[%p]
Faris ripped off my coat.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You’re really hurt, nya!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... you’re bleeding...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
I tried to avoid looking at it, but there was a lot more dark blood staining the side of my shirt than I’d expected to see.[%p]
When the man had stabbed me before, it must’ve gone in pretty deep.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m fine!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You are not fine, nya! Luka-nyan, get the first aid kit!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ok!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m ok...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Forget about me... Mayuri... How’s Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...Hahh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan?! Hang in there!”[%p]
Kagari was still lying on the sofa, panting for breath.[%p]
For the last few days, she’d been getting weaker and weaker.[%p]
Her hand reached up into the air.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma... Mamma... Where are you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mamma’s right here. I’m right beside you.”[%p]
Mayuri grabbed her hand tightly, and she finally smiled a weak smile.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma, tell me... Am I just going to disappear?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s ok. Okarin and Daru-kun will do something.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin...san...?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right. You know Okarin, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin...san...”[%p]
Kagari’s lifeless eyes turned toward me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. Just a little more... Just a little more, and you’ll be back to normal.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okabe...san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Erase me...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari...”[%p]
No.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Erase me from within her...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“At this rate, she’s going to...”[%p]
Those were Kurisu’s words.[%p]
Personality and memory were two different things.[%p]
Just because she had Kurisu’s memories, that didn’t mean she had Kurisu’s personality.[%p]
Però...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Please, Okabe-san...”[%18]
[name]Kagari[line]“Please, Okabe-san...”[%18]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Please, Okabe-san...”[%18]
[name]Kagari[line]“Erase me...”[%18]
[name]Kagari[line]“Erase me...”[%18]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Erase me...”[%18]
Those were definitely Kurisu’s words.[%p]
At least, that’s how it seemed to me.[%p]
I remembered what she’d said before.[%p]
She’d told me to save Mayuri.[%p]
She’d told me she couldn’t sacrifice Mayuri to save herself.[%p]
Maybe there was a tiny chance that Kurisu’s memories would safely settle inside Kagari’s mind.[%p]
But even if they did, I knew what she’d chosen.[%p]
She’d chosen to leave.[%p]
She’d chosen to disappear.[%p]
I had no way of knowing if the words coming out of Kagari’s mouth were from another personality created by Kurisu’s memories.[%p]
But there was no doubt that they were Kurisu’s words.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Right now, she was nothing but a formless thing called “memories.”[%p]
So why...[%p]
Why, even now when she was nothing but memories, did she still have to suffer so much?[%p]
Why did she have to suffer at all?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry, Okabe...”[%18]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry, Okabe...”[%18]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sorry, Okabe...”[%18]
Clear drops fell from her softly closed eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru... Did you find it yet?”[%p]
Kurisu![%p]
I asked him to stop myself from screaming her name.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hang on. Just a little more... Just a little more.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This isn’t good, Uncle!”[%p]
Suzuha whispered to me as she looked out the window.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“One, two, three... There’s a bunch of them outside. It’s Stratfo.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—Daru!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ok! Come on, come on, come on.”[%p]
The tension was rising every second.[%p]
Was he done yet?[%p]
Why wasn’t he done yet?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Got it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru?!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“All righty! I got it! Bingo!”[%p]
Lukako and the others brought the treatment device over, but I motioned for them to stay back as I looked down at the monitor.[%p]
Maho leaned over Daru’s other shoulder.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Look at the files that seem important and pick the biggest one!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait... The big one? Um... Could it be this one?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But the file name is John...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That was Mozart’s Christian name! That has to be it!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t get it, but ok. There are a lot of files inside it, though.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Let me see!”[%p]
Inside the folder were several files labeled with codes.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“There’s more files... There weren’t this many when we were doing the research.”[%p]
Which meant that after the Amadeus program was shut down, it had ended up in Stratfo’s hands somehow, and they’d gone on to do more experiments with it.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“One of these has to be Kagari-san’s memory data, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“K6205.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“K6205 is Kagari’s memories, Daru!”[%p]
Köchel Number 620—Il Flauto Magico.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“K620... I found it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now just do it like we talked about!”[%p]
Compared to Kurisu’s Time Leap Machine, the process was a lot simpler.[%p]
Since the memory data already existed, there was no need for a VR headset.[%p]
Or the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio).[%p]
All we had to do was use the decoder program on Kagari’s memory data, then use SERN’s LHC to compress it.[%p]
Then we transferred the compressed data and sent it to the cell phone...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hurry! We’re completely surrounded!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, are you ready?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok! Do it!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Wait!”[%p]
I looked up and saw that Maho was staring at the screen, her features frozen in an iron mask.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong, Hiyajo-san?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Is this really going to work? If it fails, Kagari-san will...”[%p]
I reached my arm around Daru’s back and put my hand firmly on her shoulder.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’ll be fine. I guarantee it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari...!”[%p]
I stepped away from the PC and knelt down in front of the sofa where Kagari lay.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okabe...san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ready?”[%p]
Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
Kurisu—[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“They’re here!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Roger!”[%p]
The sound of footsteps coming up the stairs.[%p]
The sound of the phone ringing.[%p]
As all these different sounds filled the air...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Listen, Okabe-san...”[%p]
The last thing she said was...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I think that I...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...ved you...”[%p]
Whether those were Kurisu’s words, or Kagari’s—[%p]
Her words were cut off by the sound of the door and the sound of screaming.[%p]
The phone I pressed against Kagari’s head stopped ringing, and in that moment, the world—[%p]
The world changed.[%p]
I was inside a deep black darkness.[%p]
There was no sound.[%p]
No temperature.[%p]
Just darkness, cold, and silence.[%p]
No one was here.[%p]
I didn’t even know if I was asleep or awake.[%p]
There was nothing but a vague sense of presence.[%p]
Nothingness.[%p]
Nothingness spreading out to infinity—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Huh?[%p]
What was I doing?[%p]
Wasn’t I—[%p]
[name]Woman’s voice[line]“Hey, Okabe! If you keep lying there, you’ll catch a cold.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
I turned toward the voice.[%p]
Standing there, next to the open curtains of the development room, was—[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, there you are, Kurisu.”[%p]
I—[%p]
I hesitated.[%p]
Not only did I hesitate to answer it, but I almost tried to tap the button to reject the call.[%p]
But then Kagari’s fingers cut mine off.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
And then her fingers, or maybe Kurisu’s... tapped the button to answer the call.[%p]
And then the phone up against her head[%p]
stopped ringing.[%p]
