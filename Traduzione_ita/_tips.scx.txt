Literally, “eighth-grade syndrome.”[linebreak][linebreak]A term referring to a mindset exhibited primarily by teenage males. Also used as a derogatory term to refer to older people who still exhibit this mindset.[linebreak][linebreak]Characterized by an affected attitude of nihilism or cynicism, extreme self-centeredness, delusions of power or superiority, and a consuming fear of being treated as a child. The person exhibiting these symptoms believes that they are “cool,” but most observers find them pathetic.[linebreak][linebreak]Chuunibyou, which is often abbreviated as “chuuni,” also refers to the fictional tropes that teenage males often enjoy, such as ancient conspiracies, superpowers (especially powers sealed in a character’s eye or arm), Norse mythology, battles for the fate of the multiverse, etc. The consummate chuunibyou case will work such elements into his own personal “backstory.” Okarin is a textbook example.

Noro
High-ranking priestesses that existed in 12th century Okinawa.[linebreak][linebreak]Festivals and religious rituals play an important role in Okinawan life, and it is always the job of a woman to lead them. This can be attributed to the widely-held belief that “women are the only ones who may speak with the gods,” which is an idea that can be found all around the world.[linebreak][linebreak]During the time when Okinawa was still its own independent kingdom—the “Ryukyu Kingdom”—the royal government specifically appointed priestesses called “noro,” and granted them greater authority than even some high-ranking nobles. The highest-ranking noro was referred to as the “Kikoe-ogimi,” (“The Great Lady Who Hears and Prospers”), and was second in command only to the king. Because of this, the Kikoe-ogimi’s influence extended even into politics and judicial matters.[linebreak][linebreak]Since the noro were considered to be official priestesses of the now-dissolved Ryukyu Kingdom, the only remnants of them are a few of their descendants. Thus, modern rituals are performed by civilian priestesses and spiritualists called “yuta.”

Another theory states that geographically, it could refer to Taiwan or Luzon island, but neither of these theories have been proven.[linebreak][linebreak]Incidentally, another island in the Yaeyama Islands, Yonaguni Island, has a belief in a legendary island called “Haidounan,” located at the end of the ocean.

The kingdom that would later become modern-day Okinawa.[linebreak][linebreak]The Ryukyu Kingdom’s history is quite long, stretching back for nearly half a millenium. The kingdom was an independent monarchy ruled by the King of Ryukyu, and it served as a major trading nation in Asia. Because of this, the kingdom prospered for a long 450 years.[linebreak][linebreak]The capital was located in Shuri, which was located in what is now Naha, and the king’s residence, Shuri Castle, was the administrative center. Aside from the king, high-ranking noble families called “ueekata” built castles called “gusuku” on top of mountains and hills, and ruled over their own specific areas.[linebreak][linebreak]In 1609, the Ryukyu Kingdom was invaded by the Satsuma Domain, and was forced to pay tribute to both the Satsuma Domain and the Edo Shogunate. In the process, the Ryukyu Kingdom became the “Ryukyu Domain,” but they were still allowed to maintain their independent status. However, in 1879, the Government of Meiji Japan forced them to surrender Shuri Castle, and with that, the Ryukyu Domain officially became a part of Japan as “Okinawa Prefecture.”[linebreak][linebreak]Religious rituals played an extremely important role in the Ryukyu Kingdom, and they were always performed by priestesses called “noro.”

Quantum Computer
A computer capable of using quantum superposition in order to perform parallel processing.[linebreak][linebreak]While modern-day computers switch between two signals—0 and 1—to perform their calculations, a quantum computer is capable of performing calculations with those two signals at the same time.
