Chiamata anche Probatio diabolica. Un concetto che si dice sia stato creato da un giurista nell’Europa medievale durante una causa sui diritti di possesso.[linebreak][linebreak]Il concetto è il seguente:[linebreak]Supponiamo che qualcuno vi chieda di provare che il diavolo esiste. In risposta, voi chiedete la prova che il diavolo NON esiste. Poiché il tuo avversario non ha modo di fornire tale prova, tu allora dici: “Dato che non puoi dimostrare che il diavolo non esiste, allora deve esistere!”[linebreak][linebreak]Questo è, ovviamente, un puro sofisma che non prova assolutamente nulla, ma poiché può trasformare un dibattito in un loop senza fine, l’onere della prova è tradizionalmente a carico della prima persona che fa una tale dichiarazione. [linebreak][linebreak]Al giorno d’oggi, il concetto è semplicemente usato come un mezzo per evidenziare argomenti iniqui in vari contesti, come diritto, politica o scienza.

The four spirits who control the four elements, Earth, Water, Fire, and Air.[linebreak][linebreak]The existence of the quattro elementali was first proposed by the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus nel suo trattato, “Liber de nymphis, sylphis, pygmaeis et salamandris, et de caeteris spiritibus”. He described them as beings not dead like ghosts, but not alive like humans either—they are spiritual creatures of an extremely nebulous nature. Paracelsus struggled to explain exactly what they are, and in the end decided to classify them just as “things.”[linebreak][linebreak]Paraclesus divided them as follows:[linebreak]“The element of Earth is controlled by the Pygmies of the mountain, or the Gnomes.”[linebreak]“The element of Water is controlled by the Nymphs of the Water, or the Undine.”[linebreak]“The element of Fire is controlled by the Salamanders of the Fire, or the Vulcans.”[linebreak]“The Element of Air is controlled by the Sylphs of the Wind, or the Sylvestris.”[linebreak][linebreak]Paracelsus’ theory had a huge effect on alchemists and authors in both his own generation, as well as later generations, the latter of which helped fill in the gaps in his work. In the fantasy genre in particular, elementali have become a mainstay.
