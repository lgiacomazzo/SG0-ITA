[name]Tennouji[line]“Listen, I’m not doing it because you asked me to. Just don’t forget that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
This morning, I’d gone to Tennouji and asked him to protect Kagari if something happened.[%p]
That meant I had to talk to him about his role as a Rounder again.[%p]
And I had to tell him that Kagari was caught up in something big, too.[%p]
But since this was the second time I’d had that conversation, I was able to make it go a little smoother.[%p]
That was only relative to the first time, though. I never wanted to ask him for anything like this ever again.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“So, Okabe, what the hell are you people involved in?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I—”[%p]
I stopped myself.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You can’t say, huh? You’ll ask me for a favor, but you won’t say anything?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“That’s good, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What...?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Information is your final trump card. If you had just come out and told me, I would’ve called this whole thing off.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Anyway, just be careful.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank you, sir.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I get it, I get it. Don’t be so polite! That makes it so damn hard to deal with you.”[%p]
I bowed to him once more anyway, and left the Braun Workshop.[%p]
I’d managed to get Tennouji’s help.[%p]
And this morning, I’d gotten another person on my side as well.[%p]
Kiryu Moeka...[%p]
She was a lot easier than Tennouji.[%p]
I’d checked with Daru last night, and found that just like in the old linea di universo, we’d hired her to find out more about Kagari.[%p]
All I had to do was ask her to keep looking into what Kagari had been doing before she’d come to this town.[%p]
Now I’d done everything I could in case something happened.[%p]
All that was left was to pray that nothing did.[%p]
I got back to the lab, where Lukako was waiting.[%p]
He had a very serious look on his face, and he said he needed to talk to me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“There’s something bothering me about Kagari-san’s memories...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari’s memories?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yeah... but I don’t know if it will help bring them back.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s fine. If something’s bothering you, just tell me.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ok...”[%p]
Luka started to fidget and rub his knees together. Then he looked up at me and slowly opened his mouth.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Last night, they were doing a special on memory research on TV. It was about an American university.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“When Kagari-san saw it, she acted like she recognized the school.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“An American college? Which one?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... it had a really complicated name. I think it was Biktor... Condor?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Viktor Chondria University?!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, that’s right! That’s the place!”[%p]
Viktor Chondria University.[%p]
That was where Kurisu had studied.[%p]
Kagari knew Viktor Chondria?[%p]
If that was true, then how?[%p]
The most obvious possibility was that she went there, too.[%p]
But how would a kid who went missing in Japan go to an American school? And one of the best, at that?[%p]
Of course, it wasn’t impossible, but...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What do you think? Is this a clue?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t say anything just based off of that, but...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I see.”[%p]
Lukako’s shoulders slumped in disappointment.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But that doesn’t mean it’s not a clue.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What? Then...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. It’s worth checking out.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What did you want to talk to me about?”[%p]
The best way to find out was to talk to her directly.[%p]
Kagari was just about to start work, and she seemed put off by the fact that I’d suddenly asked to speak to her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you wait just a second? I’ve asked another person to join us.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Another person?”[%p]
I didn’t know a lot about Viktor Chondria, myself.[%p]
I could ask Kagari what she knew about the school, but I couldn’t tell if her information was accurate or not.[%p]
There was a better person she could ask.[%p]
Someone who should be here any minute...[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Excuse me.”[%p]
The best way to find out about the school was to ask someone who actually went there.[%p]
In fact, Maho was to this day a part of their neuroscienze Lab.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, Maho-san. Hello.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hi. How have you been?”[%p]
Maho still didn’t know that Kagari was from the future.[%p]
I’d have to keep her from finding out.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You know, she really does look like Kurisu...”[%p]
Maho stared at Kagari, then whispered so that only I could hear.[%p]
It made sense.[%p]
I’d been surprised myself.[%p]
I started by explaining to Maho why I’d brought her here.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So, what? You think she might have gone to my school?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wait a second. I don’t know anything about this Viktor Chondrawhatsits place.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Viktor Chondria University.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“See? I didn’t even remember the name.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But yesterday you acted like you recognized it. Right, Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-Yeah. You said they did mice experiments in the back room.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“And then after that they actually showed the experiments in that room...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you remember that, Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm... I don’t.”[%p]
I couldn’t imagine Lukako would lie, or that there would be any point to him doing so.[%p]
But the same was true for Kagari, too.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Urushibara-san, do you remember where that lab was?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, I don’t know the details, but they said they were doing research on memories and the brain...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Which means it might have been the neuroscienze Lab?”[%p]
The neuroscienze Lab.[%p]
That was where—[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s where I work.”[%p]
And also where Kurisu worked, too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then... Kagari may have met you and Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s just a possibility.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“There’s more than one place that researches neuroscienze.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And it’s not just grad students where I work. There are a lot of regular scientists, too.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Even I haven’t met everyone at the lab.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But... If I saw another Japanese person there, I’m sure I’d remember that.”[%p]
Which meant she didn’t remember it... Which meant she probably hadn’t met her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, was there anything else about Kagari that you’ve noticed?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... Kagari-san sometimes knows about things that are really complicated.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hey, I know some complicated things.”[%p]
Kagari pouted.[%p]
That was one expression that was totally different than Kurisu’s.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“For example?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um... roses and... depression?”[%p]
Those were just words that were complicated to write in Japanese.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“They were doing a special on fake memories last night, and you seemed like you knew a lot about it...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Fake memories, huh? Yeah, one of the teams is working on that. We went to talk to them one time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari, can you talk about that now?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm... uh... I don’t really know. Did I really talk about that stuff?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You did!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
She put her hand between her eyebrows and thought.[%p]
She really didn’t remember, it seemed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Has this happened a lot before?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Not that much until recently. It suddenly started happening over the last few days.”[%p]
I didn’t know how Kagari could know things about Viktor Chondria.[%p]
But it clearly had something to do with her missing memories.[%p]
If I followed the trail a little longer, I might learn some clues.[%p]
It was possible I might be able to bring back her memories.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
Suddenly she started to moan in pain.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kagari-san, what’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“My head... kind of...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It hurts?”[%p]
Lukako was looking at her face, worried.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah, just a bit.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Want to lie down a little?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m fine...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe this is all too sudden.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. We may have put too much stress on her.”[%p]
Maho was looking worried, too.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Are you really ok?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Y-Yeah. I’m fine. Thank you, Senpai.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I hope so...”[%p]
The conversation was so natural[%p]
that Maho and I almost missed it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, did she just...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah... she called me ‘Senpai.’”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari, you just called Hiyajo-san ‘Senpai,’ right?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No way... I didn’t...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No, you definitely did. Urushibara-san, you heard it too, right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-Yes.”[%p]
Senpai. The Japanese word used to address an older classmate or colleague.[%p]
I’d just learned that Maho and Kagari hadn’t met at Viktor Chondria.[%p]
Did that mean it was just a mistake?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
The sound of footsteps coming up the stairs distracted me.[%p]
They were so heavy, there was no need to wonder who it was.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hello.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, you’re here, Maho-tan?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t call me that.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Do I have enough? Um... One, two, three...”[%p]
He ignored Maho’s complaint and started to count the number of people in the room. There was some kind of paper bag in his hands.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ok, I’ve got enough.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Enough what?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know how they opened a new Atol in front of the station? They were selling some good-looking pudding. I thought it might be a nice treat so I brought enough for everybody.”[%p]
He put down the bag, opened the box, and started putting the pudding cups on the table.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, do it later.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why do you all look so upset? Is it that rare for me to buy something for everybody?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, I guess it is. But I got some extra work at my job, you see.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Not only am I talented, I’m also kind-hearted and I get paid. Feel free to fall in love, ladies... Huh?”[%p]
He turned the bag over and started shaking it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m missing a spoon. I bet the staff there forgot to put one in.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I think there’s a clean spoon in the sink...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, I’ve got my own spoon I always use.”[%p]
Lukako stood up to get a spoon from the sink, then suddenly stopped.[%p]
He looked at Kagari with a confused expression.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kagari-san... Do you own a spoon?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I thought all you had with you was the Upa key chain, right?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh? That’s right, isn’t it? That’s strange. Why did I say I had one?”[%p]
Her own spoon...[%p]
I’d heard someone say that before.[%p]
Not many people carried their own spoons around.[%p]
It was common in Japan to carry around your own personal set of chopsticks lately. But not spoons.[%p]
But I knew...[%p]
I had known someone who carried around her own spoon.[%p]
It was—[%p]
Makise Kurisu.[%p]
Just a moment ago she’d called Maho “Senpai.” Did Kagari know Kurisu after all?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Hiyajo-san. How many people called you ‘Senpai’ in America?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Just one.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s a Japanese word, and a Japanese concept, after all.”[%p]
There was no need to even ask who it was.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The only one who called me ‘Senpai...’”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...was Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ku...risu...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari, do you know a girl named Makise Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Kurisu... Makise Kurisu...”[%p]
Did she know her, and was she imitating her?[%p]
But why would she need to do that?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Makise Kurisu...”[%p]
Kagari seemed to be desperately searching her memories, but it didn’t seem to be working.[%p]
There was sweat on her forehead. Her headache might still be bothering her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t force yourself. There’s no need to remember immediately—”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No... It feels creepy leaving it like this.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Do you feel like you can remember something?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t know. Try saying something, Okarin-san.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Wha—? What’s going on here?”[%p]
The fact that Kagari responded this strongly to Kurisu’s name meant there had to be some relationship.[%p]
What could there possibly be?[%p]
The question was this: what had Kagari been doing ever since she separated from Suzuha in 1998?[%p]
If she never met Maho, did she ever meet Kurisu?[%p]
Maybe she became friends with Kurisu, and learned a lot about her. Then she’d gotten Kurisu’s stories mixed up with her own memories?[%p]
Or—[%p]
I remembered the machine that Kurisu had developed in the linea di universo Alfa and came up with a certain hypothesis.[%p]
I quickly told myself that it was impossible.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
My eyes met Maho’s.[%p]
She nodded.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok, Kagari, let me ask you some questions.”[%p]
For now, I wanted to learn how much Kagari knew about Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where is your father?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Daddy... Daddy died when I was a kid.”[%p]
If her memories were mixed with Kurisu’s, she wouldn’t say that.[%p]
Those were Kagari’s memories.[%p]
She said she remembered everything from before she was ten years old.[%p]
She’d only lost her memories after she’d separated from Suzuha in 1998.[%p]
I’d have to go a little deeper.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then what does the word ‘KuriGohan’ mean to you?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“KuriGohan? What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Answer me please, Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“KuriGohan...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Kamehameha...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Everyone else seemed confused.[%p]
But I felt as if my heart was about to stop.[%p]
How could she know?[%p]
“KuriGohan and Kamehameha” was Kurisu’s @channel aggancio.[%p]
Not only did she keep that a secret, she almost never let anyone know that she posted on @channel.[%p]
She never would’ve told anyone.[%p]
How could Kagari know something that only Kurisu should know?[%p]
More sweat was pouring down Kagari’s forehead.[%p]
Luka offered her a handkerchief, worried.[%p]
Kagari nodded and took it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari, can you tell me how many major theories of time travel there are?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho looked like she wanted to say something, but I motioned for her to stay quiet.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Eleven.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Kagari spoke clearly, as if the answer was the most obvious thing in the world.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Eleven in total...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wait, is that right?”[%p]
I hadn’t expected much when I’d asked the question. I certainly hadn’t expected that.[%p]
The terrifying possibility I’d thought of earlier was becoming more and more real.[%p]
It was impossible. It had to be.[%p]
The more I tried to convince myself, the more my fears grew.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you tell me what these eleven theories are?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...Neutron Star Theory. And then... Black Hole Theory. Lightspeed Theory.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Tachyon Theory. Wormhole Theory. Exotic Matter Theory.”[%p]
Kagari was counting with her fingers, and speaking with very little hesitation.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Cosmic String Theory. Quantum Gravity Theory. Cesium Laser Theory.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Elementary Particle Ring & Laser Theory. And lastly, Dirac Antiparticle Theory.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Those are all correct...”[%p]
Maho’s voice was hoarse.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Tell me, Okabe-san... How do I know all this?”[%p]
Kagari looked like she was about to cry a little.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can I ask you one more thing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Could you use those theories to build a time machine?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t think so...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, but, even if you couldn’t use these eleven theories, science may invent a new theory that works someday...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why do you think so?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why? That’s because... Hmm... I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then let me ask another question. How did you arrive at that conclusion?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t know... Just, somehow, I knew.”[%p]
She knew, huh?[%p]
That meant the knowledge existed inside of her.[%p]
But why did she have that knowledge?[%p]
Had she been to Viktor Chondria at some time in the past and met Kurisu there? Maybe they were close friends?[%p]
So close that Kurisu would share her @channel nickname, which she never told anyone?[%p]
And then perhaps she mistook what she’d heard from Kurisu for her own memories.[%p]
That was the most obvious possibility.[%p]
But that would go against what Kurisu had said.[%p]
Kurisu said she didn’t really have any close friends in America.[%p]
She seemed to have developed a solid relationship with Maho at work, but...[%p]
The dark fear in my mind kept growing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Hiyajo-san. Remember how you said Amadeus was put on hold?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does the uploaded memory data for [Kurisu] still exist?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh? Yeah, probably. I don’t think it was erased.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many people could access that?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Very few. We never really announced it anywhere.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Myself, Dr. Leskinen, a few of the other assistants, and then Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Another question... Would it be possible to transfer that memory data to a human brain?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
In the other linea di universo, Maho herself—or Dr. Leskinen, to be precise—had said something about that at the ATF seminar.[%p]
And I had experienced it myself...[%p]
Through a machine that digitized human memories, sent them through time, and then back to the same person’s brain.[%p]
It didn’t exist in this linea di universo, but,[%p]
I’d once lived in a linea di universo where it was developed in this very room.[%p]
I’d used it far more times than I had ever wanted to.[%p]
And because of that experience, I came up with an idea.[%p]
A terrifying idea.[%p]
Another way to explain what was happening to Kagari now.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What are you getting at—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu was the one who had her own personal spoon.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She was the only one who called you ‘Senpai’ at school.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“KuriGohan and Kamehameha was Kurisu’s [color index="280AA02D1400"]aggancio[color index="800000"] on @channel. I’m the only one who knew about it besides her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu would know about the lab at Viktor Chondria.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She would know about the mouse experiments.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She would know about the eleven theories of time travel.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin...san? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What are you trying to say?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is my idea.”[%p]
I looked around the room at everyone, then back at Kagari.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari, it’s possible that you may have Makise Kurisu’s memories inside you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kagari has Makise Kurisu’s memories?”[%p]
Suzuha didn’t seem as surprised as I had expected.[%p]
Maho and I asked her some more questions after that.[%p]
About Viktor Chondria.[%p]
About her research.[%p]
Her answers were all over the place.[%p]
Some things she knew, and some things she didn’t.[%p]
But some of the things she knew were things that only Maho and Kurisu would have known.[%p]
In the end, instead of being overturned, my hypothesis came out even stronger.[%p]
All the questions seemed to tire Kagari out, and with Tennouji’s permission, Lukako took her home.[%p]
Maho completely refused to accept what I was saying, but did say before she left that she’d look into whether it was possible to transfer Amadeus’s memory data into a human brain.[%p]
And that night, I explained the situation to Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So you mean Kagari has two personalities?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The proper word for multiple personalities is dissociative identity disorder. That’s when additional personalities are created within the person themselves.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s like... you’re upset or uneasy about who you are, so you make another personality within yourself.”[%p]
Once in a while, there would be a case where someone would take the personality of the man or woman they admired, but usually it was a completely original one.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But that’s not what’s going on in Kagari’s case.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She doesn’t have her personality. What she’s got is, quite literally, only Kurisu’s memories.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s possible that Kurisu’s memories are mixed in with her own.”[%p]
Kagari’s memories weren’t overwritten.[%p]
She still had them.[%p]
So they had mixed together.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I see.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“With 2036’s technology, that’s certainly possible.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then since Kagari’s a time traveler from that year, it’s a possibility?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But she has her memories from when she was ten, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If they put someone else’s memories into her head, she should remember that, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think I remember her saying once in a while back then that she heard the voice of God.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A hallucination? It’s possible that that’s a product of Kurisu’s memories leaking out.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But the future wasn’t as peaceful as this era. There weren’t enough people, and there weren’t enough supplies.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Even if they did have memory transfer technology, it would’ve been a military secret.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I can’t imagine them using it on a civilian. Especially a kid...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari was a war orphan. There’s no chance it was used to cure her [color index="280AA02D1400"]PTSD[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That wouldn’t explain why they’d want to transfer someone else’s memories into her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...That’s right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which means it’s more likely that it was done during the time when she had no memories—between 1998 and now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Even if it’s possible in 2036, is it possible right now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu could do it.”[%p]
She’d done it all by herself to make the Time Leap Machine, after all.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So Makise Kurisu transferred her own memories to Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why would she do that? It’s like something a mad scientist would do.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
There was no way.[%p]
It was impossible. It had to be.[%p]
And there weren’t many people as smart as Makise Kurisu.[%p]
If she didn’t do it, I couldn’t imagine anyone else would.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right... I’m getting ahead of myself. I agree.”[%p]
I might have been getting too attached to my own idea.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But there’s no doubt that Kagari knows things only Kurisu could know.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe, like, Makise-shi’s soul became a ghost and possessed her?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t even think of saying that around Hiyajo-san. She’ll laugh in your face.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’ve got that right.”[%p]
In the end, I realized there was nothing I could do for Kagari but watch for a while to see how things went.[%p]
We were just students, without any kind of specialized knowledge.[%p]
No matter how much we debated, or what ideas we came up with, we wouldn’t be able to find the answer easily.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come to think of it, Daru, what’s Yuki-san up to?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Amane-shi’s busy with work every day, it looks like.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What does she do again?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Works at a cake bakery, I heard. She said it’s really good, and we should go check it out.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s right. But it’s a little far away, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s why she’d be happy if you went, right? Get a grip, Dad.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, right. [color index="280AA02D1400"]Soz[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, Okarin. Why are you asking, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, no reason. I was just curious...”[%p]
That girl in the motorcycle suit.[%p]
Could that have been Amane Yuki?[%p]
I still hadn’t convinced myself it wasn’t her.[%p]
If it was, she may be involved in some way with what was happening to Kagari.[%p]
But that attack only took place in the other linea di universo.[%p]
It hadn’t happened in this one, so I had no way to tell.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If there was something she...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is there something going on with Mom?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s nothing.”[%p]
I still didn’t have any proof.[%p]
I’d have to just keep an eye on her.[%p]
My priority right now was Kagari.[%p]
What had happened during the time when she’d lost her memories?[%p]
If I could find that out, I might be able to understand what was about to happen to us.[%p]
