For the first time in almost four months, I felt like the whole world was twisting.[%p]
Who was it?[%p]
Who had changed the worldline?![%p]
I didn’t do anything. I hadn’t interfered with the world.[%p]
So why was the world doing this to me?![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I opened my eyes.[%p]
Things had already taken on different colors.[%p]
The world kept wavering, until once again it became fixed to a single point in time.[%p]
I wasn’t looking at a warm, cheerful party in the lab anymore.[%p]
I was outside.[%p]
It was raining.[%p]
The rain was falling on my face, in drops so large that it hurt.[%p]
It was a midwinter rain. It was freezing cold, and I could feel it sapping the strength from my body.[%p]
My view stopped twisting.[%p]
I was staring at the broad back of a man I didn’t know.[%p]
I could hear the sound of many boots stamping through the mud, mingling with falling rain.[%p]
The stench was terrible. The smell of sewage was so strong it hurt to breathe. And it was mixed with the awful smell of burning rubber and plastic.[%p]
Where was I? What was I doing right now?[%p]
Things around me had changed so much.[%p]
I tried to understand the situation I was in, but my brain was having an awful time keeping up.[%p]
[name]Man’s voice[line]“We’re almost there. Hang in there.”[%p]
When I stopped, a rough hand patted me on the shoulder encouragingly.[%p]
I looked around to see a man my age, with a strong, powerful face.[%p]
It was a face I’d never seen. I didn’t know him... probably.[%p]
The man was wearing the camo outfit and equipment I’d often seen the Self-Defense Force wear on the news. He was carrying an assault rifle on his shoulder.[%p]
There were seven or eight people around me, all dressed the same.[%p]
They surrounded me in a circular formation and walked forward silently, as they kept a careful eye on the area around them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](Are these people... the Self-Defense Force?)[%p]
And then I realized...[%p]
I was wearing the same camo uniform they were.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](I’m in the SDF, too?!)[%p]
I touched my bicep to check, but there was no muscle. It was flabby and weak. Unlike the others, I wasn’t carrying any weapons.[%p]
Then what was going on here?[%p]
It felt like these seven or eight tough-looking SDF guys were all guarding me...[%p]
Since when was I that important?[%p]
Still confused, I dragged myself onward.[%p]
Where was I, anyway?[%p]
It was a long path filled with dark brown mud.[%p]
The walls formed a tall silhouette to the left and right.[%p]
The path was filled with garbage and concrete rubble, and sometimes we had to force our way past it.[%p]
I looked up past the high walls. Despite the rain, the moon in the night sky was strangely red and a little too bright.[%p]
It was thanks to the moon that we were able to walk down a path like this without flashlights.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Sound. I heard a sound.[%p]
It was... the sound of water.[%p]
I looked over and saw a hole opened in one of the walls. Filthy water was pouring out. The water formed dozens of little rivers that blocked our path.[%p]
So that was it. This was the bottom of a river that had dried up. What looked like high walls were the river dikes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are we?!”[%p]
I turned toward the man who had spoken to me a bit ago, and yelled so that my voice could be heard over the rain.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“Ssh! Don’t make any loud noises.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, sorry...”[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“We’re almost through the city center. If we can make it to Nerima Garrison, there’ll be a car waiting for you. So just keep walking—”[%p]
But—his words cut off there.[%p]
Everyone seemed more tense than ever.[%p]
One of them grabbed me and pushed me toward the side of the riverbed.[%p]
Everyone put their backs against the wall and held their breath.[%p]
I could hear the sound of a helicopter’s rotors in the distance.[%p]
No, more than just one.[%p]
They were getting closer.[%p]
I had no idea what was going on, but I could feel my heart start to beat faster.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“Get in the shadow of that car.”[%p]
Past several meters of rubble lay an overturned car.[%p]
It must’ve fallen into the riverbed after the water had disappeared. The entire body was bent inward, and the roof was completely crushed.[%p]
I lay down in the stinking mud and slid into the shadow of the overturned car.[%p]
At the same time, the SDF soldiers were issuing each other orders, as if this was something they’d planned for already.[%p]
Two of them stayed by my side, and everyone else ran back the way we’d come.[%p]
They all climbed up crevices and outcroppings on the wall, then disappeared over the edge of the dike and out of my view.[%p]
Shortly after...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Those were... gunshots.[%p]
And not just a single shot from a handgun, or anything like that.[%p]
This was the sound of war.[%p]
I could hear the helicopters get further away, drawn by the gunfire.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Oh no.”[%p]
In this worldline, was Japan... at war?[%p]
—The Third World War.[%p]
I remembered Suzuha’s words.[%p]
I happened to look inside the crushed car...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
I could see the corpses of a man, a woman, and a small child hanging upside down, still attached to their seat belts.[%p]
They were all covered in dried black blood. They looked like mannequins at a bad haunted house.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aaah... Aaah...”[%p]
And then I realized...[%p]
I’d been so focused on moving forward that I hadn’t noticed what they were, but I’d seen similar “mannequins” sunk into the mud...[%p]
I could see their arms, the bones and ragged muscle exposed to the air, reaching up to the sky as if seeking salvation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
I put my hand over my mouth to stifle a scream.[%p]
Those weren’t mannequins...![%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“Now! Get along the side of the wall and move!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh...?”[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“We’re changing the route. Come on, stand up.”[%p]
He pulled me up. My knees were shaking from shock and exhaustion.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“The others are drawing away the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Soviet[color index="800000"] helicopters, but that won’t last long. Hurry.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Soviet helicopters?”[%p]
My mind was dulled from the terror, but it seemed like there was something off about what he just said.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“Get a hold of yourself. Do you know how many people have died to protect you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Protect... me? Why?”[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“We haven’t been told why. But we were told to lay down our lives for you if we had to. And that you could change this country’s future.”[%p]
A helicopter passed over the riverbed. The bright searchlight passed by for a moment, but thankfully, the shadow of the dike hid us.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“This way.”[%p]
The young SDF soldier, whose name I didn’t even know, pulled me inside one of the holes in the concrete.[%p]
When I looked closely, I could see that it was the entrance to a sewer.[%p]
It was just big enough for a single person to pass through.[%p]
Struggling against the flow of water that came up to my knees, I pressed on through the darkness.[%p]
My sense of smell had already gone numb, so I didn’t have to worry about the stench of the sewage.[%p]
Once inside, we came to several branching paths.[%p]
The SDF soldiers seemed to know which one would lead where, and they marched on without hesitation.[%p]
And then we came out of the sewer and back into a riverbed.[%p]
It was dried up, just like the one we’d just been through.[%p]
I didn’t know if it was the same river, or another one, and the two soldiers didn’t tell me.[%p]
Either way, I was glad to be finally out of the foul-smelling darkness, and I tried to take a deep breath and fill my lungs with fresh air.[%p]
But—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh... ah...?”[%p]
Halfway through I realized that the riverbed smelled even worse than the sewer. I took an involuntary step back, and then another.[%p]
The sight in front of me was just that terrible.[%p]
What was once a riverbed was now filled with bodies.[%p]
Some of them had been burnt totally black, so it was impossible to tell how much death lay before me.[%p]
And in the distance, I could see what looked like bonfires.[%p]
They were burning despite the rain.[%p]
The fires were consuming the mountains of flesh that once were human bodies.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“We’re almost there. I know it’s rough, but can you run?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh? Uh... yeah.”[%p]
The SDF soldier spoke to me.[%p]
And then I came back to my senses.[%p]
If it weren’t for these two, I wouldn’t have been able to stay sane.[%p]
We ran through the riverbed, one of them in front of me, the other behind.[%p]
I could hear the constant drone of the helicopters above me. Sometimes the searchlights got very close.[%p]
Each time they did, I hid in the piles of bodies until they passed.[%p]
I’d seen this many times before as I’d wandered through the worldlines.[%p]
I’d seen death.[%p]
I’d seen the moments when people had died.[%p]
But at the same time, I’d never experienced what happened to a dead person after they were left out for a long time.[%p]
More than fear, more than sorrow, the thing that hit me first was the smell of death.[%p]
The rotting stench ate away at my body, not my soul.[%p]
My whole body was rejecting it.[%p]
It made me feel sick.[%p]
Thinking that way meant trampling on the dignity of the dead, but I couldn’t help it.[%p]
“The Valley of Hinnom.”[%p]
I remembered that phrase.[%p]
That was what that strange attacker had said that night, when they came after Dr. Leskinen, Maho, and me.[%p]
[name]Assailant[line]“It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the Valley of Hinnom.”[%p]
That valley was the origin of the word Gehenna, meaning “hell.” It was said that flames burned there every night, scorching the heavens themselves.[%p]
Those who died merciless deaths with anger or misery in their hearts were flung into the flames, their souls becoming black smoke that rained hatred down on the land.[%p]
What I stared at now was Gehenna.[%p]
The two soldiers led me to a half-collapsed subway tunnel.[%p]
The lights were all off because there was no electricity, but there were three armored cars in camo colors, with their headlights on to illuminate the way.[%p]
They were four-wheel drive, off-road vehicles covered in thick chunks of armor, but I didn’t see any real weapons.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“You can take the subway route to escape to Saitama. I hear it’s still safe at [color index="280AA02D1400"]Iruma Base[color index="800000"]. If you can get that far, you should be able to escape Kanto.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Escape... Kanto...?”[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“Ask them about it. For now, just hurry.”[%p]
There were a lot of things I wanted to ask, but even as we spoke I heard what sounded like gunshots outside the tunnel. The men forced me into the back seat of one of the cars.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“Goodbye. I’ll be praying for your safety.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? What about you guys?”[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“We have another mission to carry out. Farewell.”[%p]
The two soldiers who had brought me here saluted, then turned around and left the station.[%p]
I felt like I was never going to see them again.[%p]
The door of the armored car slammed shut with a heavy thud.[%p]
The car’s crew were SDF soldiers, just a little older than me.[%p]
The diesel engine kicked to life, and the car raced down a tunnel that had originally been designed for trains.[%p]
Of course, it wasn’t a pleasant ride at all, but I didn’t have any choice.[%p]
There was no way I could tell them I wanted to go to Akihabara.[%p]
I had no way to alter the worldline.[%p]
I had to survive in this hellish world.[%p]
And to survive, I needed to do what they said.[%p]
My wants didn’t matter at all. I wasn’t even allowed to express them.[%p]
I just did as they told me and ran.[%p]
It was all I could do.[%p]
But I had no idea that it would take an entire month.[%p]
The reason it took a month to get to Okinawa was that we were losing the war.[%p]
Supposedly, the plan had been to ferry me by plane to Okinawa once I’d arrived at Iruma Base.[%p]
But the constant bombing had slowed us down, so they gave up on the plane and decided I would escape to Kyushu by ground.[%p]
There was more than one attack by Soviet spies and assault teams. Some of the SDF soldiers protecting me died.[%p]
But when I got to Sasebo, I was able to get on a maritime SDF escort ship, and managed to escape to Okinawa.[%p]
Why were they doing all this for me?[%p]
No matter how many times I asked, no one would answer.[%p]
Okinawa in winter was covered in thick clouds.[%p]
Come to think of it, I hadn’t seen a real break in the clouds for a whole month.[%p]
I was thinking about that when I was loaded into a van with dark-tinted windows that had come to pick me up from the port.[%p]
Inside the car was not only the driver, but a middle-aged man sitting in the front passenger seat.[%p]
He was very short, perhaps only around 150 centimeters tall.[%p]
But he had the air of a military veteran, and even though he was fully dressed, I could tell he was extremely muscular.[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“Okabe Rintaro-kun, correct?”[%p]
[name]SDF personnel[line]“I’m Shimoyama, with the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Ministry of Defense[color index="800000"]’s Intelligence Security Command.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“We’re going to make a stop at the airport, and then head to the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Okinawa Defense Bureau[color index="800000"] in Kadena. I’m sure you’re tired from your long journey, but I’ll have to ask you to hang in there a while longer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Right.”[%p]
I’d heard that Tokyo had been destroyed.[%p]
The major functions of the Japanese government were now headquartered out of the Okinawa Defense Bureau, to allow for better cooperation with the American forces stationed nearby.[%p]
That’s what Shimoyama explained to me.[%p]
In other words, the place I was heading to was the core of Japan’s defenses.[%p]
Once I arrived, would I understand why I was so important that all those soldiers were willing to die to protect me?[%p]
The car stopped in front of [color index="280AA02D1400"]Naha Airport[color index="800000"] for a while.[%p]
And then I saw a surprising pair get aboard.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“O-Okabe-san!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Wow, it’s really Okarin-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re... Yuki-san and Nakase-san!”[%p]
I wasn’t expecting to see them there.[%p]
But they were the first people I knew who I’d met since coming to this worldline.[%p]
That alone was almost enough to make me cry.[%p]
But still, I couldn’t just sit there and be happy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about Mayuri? Do you know where she is?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“She’s fine.”[%p]
Yuki nodded, as if trying to make me feel better.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“She was just with us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just with you?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“That’s right. Mayushii, and Rumiho-chan, and Luka-kun, and Kaede-chan.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“We got to the airport this morning. We were all waiting because they said we could go to some place called the Defense Bureau, where we’d be safe.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“They just said they’d take Fubuki-chan and me there first...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“And then they had us get inside this car, where we found you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, I’m glad everybody’s safe.”[%p]
Since Daru and Suzuha weren’t mentioned, I was going to ask about them, but...[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Sorry, but can you talk about this later?”[%p]
Shimoyama cut me off, and the car started moving.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“The plan is for your families to arrive at the Okinawa Defense Bureau eventually. We already have them under our protection.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“R-Really?! I’m so glad...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Your other friends are all in the car behind us. You haven’t been separated, so don’t worry.”[%p]
I took a quick look, and saw another identical van a little behind us.[%p]
So Mayuri and the others were there?[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Then we’ll see them later, right?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Of course.”[%p]
Yuki let out a sigh of relief.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
But then I started to wonder about something else.[%p]
Why were we split into different cars?[%p]
This van could hold at least another three people. If we squeezed tight it could easily hold everyone.[%p]
Or was there some reason they’d put me, Yuki, and Fubuki into the same car?[%p]
The car drove alongside the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Okinawa monorail[color index="800000"] for a while, and then went south down a wide bypass.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s so dark...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? What was that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing, just... there are all these stores... but they’re all dark.”[%p]
There were lots of franchise restaurants, big supermarkets, cafeterias for tourists, and rent-a-car places all jammed together along the side of the road.[%p]
But all of them were dead silent, and their lights were turned off.[%p]
Barely any of the street lights were turned on, and the only cars were Japanese and US military vehicles. I didn’t see anyone out walking.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“There’s a blackout in effect, as well as a curfew past 5:00 PM.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Okinawa may be safe, but this is still wartime. Things can’t be like they were.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I can’t wait for the war to end and everything to go back to normal.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Wartime, huh?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tell me, Okabe-kun. The Okinawa you knew was a bright, fun place, even at night, wasn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, I wouldn’t know. I’ve never been to Okinawa before.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“That’s a shame. Then I pray you get to come back for a good vacation sometime. This really is a nice island.”[%p]
The car headed up from the bypass over a land bridge, and then to another road. We quickly came to a long tunnel.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I actually wanted to ask the three of you some questions before we got to the Bureau. That’s why I have you riding with me.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
My guess was right.[%p]
That meant there was something he wanted to ask just the three of us.[%p]
But why us three?[%p]
I wasn’t particularly close to Yuki or Fubuki.[%p]
I’d only even started talking to them a few months ago—[%p]
And then I shook my head.[%p]
That was before the worldline changed.[%p]
Maybe things were different in this worldline.[%p]
I had no idea what my relationship was to anyone else in this worldline.[%p]
Since the SDF had been treating me so well, I didn’t want to make Shimoyama suspicious.[%p]
I decided it would be best to leave most of the talking to Yuki and Fubuki.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Amane Yuki-san.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Y-Yes?”[%p]
Shimoyama spoke to Yuki first.[%p]
Yuki went stiff when her name was called. I could feel it even sitting next to her.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“You don’t know where Hashida Itaru-kun and his little sister are, do you?”[%p]
Little sister...[%p]
That must be Suzuha.[%p]
That would mean that even in this worldline Suzuha had come from the future, and gotten to know Yuki and the others while pretending to be Daru’s sister.[%p]
And the SDF evidently didn’t know where Daru and Suzuha were.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“No, I...”[%p]
Yuki fell silent and glanced over to me, as if expecting help.[%p]
But I didn’t know where they were, either.[%p]
I didn’t even have any memories of this worldline, so I had no way of answering.[%p]
But Yuki’s attitude bothered me.[%p]
It was as if she knew where they were and was deliberately hiding it, and that I was supposed to be hiding it, too.[%p]
I could figure that out, I’m sure Shimoyama could, too.[%p]
A strange tension filled the car.[%p]
Yuki was trying to hide it? From whom?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Hmm? You’re sure you don’t know?”[%p]
Shimoyama turned around from the front passenger seat and asked again.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I’m sorry.”[%p]
Yuki bowed her head in apology.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“But you were very close to him, weren’t you? You were his lover, and yet you heard nothing?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You know that cell phones don’t work anymore, right?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“There are plenty of ways to get in touch with someone besides a cell phone.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But I really don’t...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Nothing from his sister, either?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“By the way, I’m told that you were researching something with Hashida-kun, Okabe-kun?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
I wasn’t sure how to react when the conversation suddenly turned toward me.[%p]
Researching? Researching what?[%p]
Uh-oh. If I panic, I’ll make them suspicious.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“What were you researching?”[%p]
I would just have to give him the most harmless answers I could.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It wasn’t really research... it was more like... inventions.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Inventions?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like whether you could attach a [color index="280AA02D1400"]CCD camera[color index="800000"] to a bamboo copter to do aerial photography...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Or whether you could use the heat from a vacuum cleaner as a hair dryer...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Oh? That’s interesting.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Then you weren’t, say, making something unbelievable, and running away from us so that we wouldn’t find out what it was?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Running away?”[%p]
Damn. I responded.[%p]
That was a mistake.[%p]
But did that mean that Daru and Suzuha were hiding from the SDF amidst all this chaos?[%p]
The SDF had risked their lives to protect me over the past month.[%p]
Shouldn’t I be asking them for help?[%p]
I got even more confused.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“If you don’t know, then that’s fine. We’ll talk about Hashida-kun and his sister some other time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Somebody, please tell me what the right answer is.[%p]
How am I supposed to respond here?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Um... Nakase Katsumi-san? There was something else I wanted to ask you.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“M-Me?”[%p]
This time it was Fubuki’s turn to jump up in her seat.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No, no. Don’t get so nervous. It’s nothing big.”[%p]
Or so Shimoyama said, but Fubuki was clearly starting to get scared.[%p]
Her reaction was strange. It was too strong.[%p]
Maybe the Self-Defense Forces weren’t simply protecting us.[%p]
For one thing, there was no way normal civilians like us merited such important treatment.[%p]
But then what were they after?[%p]
No, I could guess.[%p]
The time machine.[%p]
This war started with Russia’s time machine experiments.[%p]
And of course, Nakabachi was involved. I’d learned from some of the soldiers that even in this worldline he’d sought asylum in Russia.[%p]
And Suzuha was a time traveler from the year 2036.[%p]
If Suzuha was here in this era, that meant that it was Daru who made the time machine that brought her here.[%p]
If you had a time machine, you could change the outcome of this war.[%p]
It would make sense if that’s what the Japanese government thought, and if that was why they were trying to capture Daru, Suzuha, and their friends.[%p]
Once I realized that, the whole situation started to feel terrifying to me.[%p]
Was this car really headed toward the Okinawa Defense Bureau?[%p]
And if it was, were they really going to keep us safe there?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“About the physical you underwent last week...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“W-Was there some problem?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No. You’ve almost recovered from the wounds you sustained in Tokyo, and health-wise, you’re fine. But you’re under a lot of stress.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Well, it’s not surprising. You survived that terrible bombing. It’s no exaggeration to say that most civilians have [color index="280AA02D1400"]PTSD[color index="800000"] now.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“But it seems that your symptoms are a little different than most people’s.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“You have very realistic dreams, for example.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“In particularly severe instances, they could almost be called waking dreams... I’m told at times you lose the ability to tell the difference between dreams and reality.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Isn’t that just PTSD, though?”[%p]
Fubuki was too scared to speak, so Yuki interrupted curtly.[%p]
It was rare to see Yuki act like this.[%p]
If nothing else, I’d never seen it before.[%p]
It was plain now.[%p]
Yuki didn’t trust Shimoyama. In fact, she considered him an enemy.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No, it’s very strange...”[%p]
Shimoyama paused a moment for effect, and rubbed his chin.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“There are others who say they have very similar dreams. And not just one or two.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Of course, the degree to which they suffer from this problem changes, but we’ve found more than ten in Japan alone.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“They exist in other countries, too. Well, we’ve only got information from the West...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s just a coincidence, isn’t it?”[%p]
Fubuki was incredibly frightened.[%p]
So I spoke in her place.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“You’ve heard of [color index="280AA02D1400"]Puchin[color index="800000"], right?”[%p]
Suddenly Shimoyama turned his gaze toward me, and asked me a question.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Puchin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Soviet... General Secretary, right?”[%p]
I almost said the President of Russia, but managed to stop myself.[%p]
The Soviet Union still existed in this worldline. Puchin’s title was General Secretary, not President. I’d heard that during my time at Iruma.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Correct. But interestingly enough, Nakase-san referred to him as the President of Russia.”[%p]
What?[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“I’m sorry. I wasn’t paying attention. And I’m not really what you’d call a good student.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No, that’s not it. It’s one of the strange things about all the people who have these dreams. They all call him President Puchin.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“And they all call [color index="280AA02D1400"]Golbachev[color index="800000"] and [color index="280AA02E1400"]Leltsin[color index="800000"] presidents, too.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“That’s why the scientists have started calling it ‘President’s Disease.’ Not a terribly clever name, if you ask me.”[%p]
N-No way...[%p]
Is he talking about... Reading Steiner?[%p]
There was a strong chance that people besides me had that power, even if not as acutely.[%p]
I’d never found out for sure, but what Faris had said in the Alpha worldline certainly suggested it.[%p]
So it was certainly possible that Shimoyama’s “waking dreams” were actually the effects of Reading Steiner.[%p]
If they were all aware of the worldline shift a month ago, just like me...[%p]
If Fubuki had the same memories of the other worldline that I had...[%p]
It would make perfect sense that she called Puchin a president.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Golbachev? Leltsin?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“You don’t know them? Didn’t they teach that in world history?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I only took science classes in high school...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I thought everyone knew about them. Do kids today not know who they are? I find it hard to believe you’re all that ignorant.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I’m sure you know about Golbachev and Leltsin, right, Okabe-kun?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-Yeah, I suppose so.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“And [color index="280AA02E1400"]perestroika[color index="800000"], and the fall of the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Berlin Wall[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, they were in the textbooks...”[%p]
The second after the words were out of my mouth, an alarm went off in my mind.[%p]
—Something was wrong. There was something strange about what Shimoyama was saying.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
And then I realized.[%p]
The East and West were caught up in the middle of a World War. How could the Berlin Wall have fallen?[%p]
And could Golbachev really execute perestroika?[%p]
By the time I realized he’d tricked me, it was too late. My panic appeared on my face.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“...You too, huh?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“And you were deliberately trying to hide it, weren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“So the information was right after all. You know something important.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Listen, Okabe-kun. I want you to tell me.”[%p]
Shimoyama suddenly laughed. It was a bitter laugh, almost eerily so.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Golbachev? Leltsin? Who are these people you all keep talking about?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“We don’t have any data on them, and neither do any of the American intelligence agencies. That data doesn’t exist.”[%p]
Doesn’t exist?[%p]
I looked over at Yuki.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
From the look on her face I could tell that she really had no idea who they were.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Perestroika? The Fall of the Berlin Wall? Did these things really happen?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tell me, please.”[%p]
But I couldn’t answer.[%p]
I was thinking of something completely different.[%p]
I suddenly realized why the worldline might have changed a month ago on Christmas Eve.[%p]
What if Russia used the time machine that day, in an experiment to change the past?[%p]
The goal of the experiment would’ve been to stop the collapse of the Soviet Union.[%p]
And if the result of their changing the past was this worldline...![%p]
How foolish...![%p]
A single change to the past and the [color index="280AA02D1400"]butterfly effect[color index="800000"] makes the entire world so different.[%p]
Did they know how many people had died?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Have you and your friends really experienced the history of a different world?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I just can’t believe it. It’s just nonsense cooked up by some crazy scientists—”[%p]
He was about to push me further when—[%p]
We heard the sound of an incoming call on a cell phone.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tch...”[%p]
Shimoyama grunted and took his phone out of his pocket.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“This is Shimoyama.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Yeah, we’re on our way to the Bureau.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“What? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Damn it! That’s the problem with these idiots. What country do these politicians think they’re working for?”[%p]
Shimoyama’s finger slammed down on the “end call” button so hard I thought the phone would break. There was a look of rage on his face.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“We’re changing our destination. Head to [color index="280AA02D1400"]Kadena Base[color index="800000"]. Gate 2.”[%p]
His words were filled with irritation as he spoke to the driver.[%p]
Changing destinations?[%p]
Who was he just talking to?[%p]
As I sat there confused, Shimoyama started to call someone else.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“This is Shimoyama. We’re changing our destination. We’ll meet at Gate 2 at Kadena Base.”[%p]
That was all he said before he hung up.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um... what’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“The situation’s changed. Okabe-kun is heading to a US military base.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“From there, he might get to take a fun trip on a US Air Force plane to America.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha—?!”[%p]
America?![%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I’ll ask them to make sure you get first-class accommodations, but don’t get your hopes up. They don’t listen to us any more than you’d listen to a yapping pet dog.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why America?!”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I don’t know if it’s the [color index="280AA02D1400"]CIA[color index="800000"] or the [color index="280AA02E1400"]NSC[color index="800000"], but someone wants us to hand you over.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But why?!”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Ask them yourself.”[%p]
And then he turned back toward the front and fell silent, refusing to answer any of my questions.[%p]
The car went down the road for a while, until we got off at an exit that read “South Okinawa.”[%p]
We stopped in front of the gate.[%p]
Several US soldiers had evidently been waiting for my arrival.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Once we hand you over to the Americans, we’re not going to get any accurate information from them.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“So this is my last chance.”[%p]
Shimoyama turned around from the front passenger seat and looked straight at me.[%p]
His eyes were desperate, and begging.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tell me. What are we supposed to do from now on?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Please.”[%p]
I remembered all the soldiers in Tokyo who’d fought so desperately to protect me.[%p]
Were they fighting to help someone else in Tokyo right now? Or were they already...?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Okabe-kun...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I really don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you think I can do something about this war all by myself?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Knowing that Golbachev and Leltsin were presidents of Russia, or that they brought a dramatic end to the Cold War... that doesn’t actually help anything.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“...”[%p]
I could hear the sound of another car getting closer.[%p]
Shimoyama sighed and opened the passenger side door.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Get out.”[%p]
I exited the car as I was told.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Mayuri got out of the van behind us and ran over to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
My childhood friend flung herself into my arms, and I held her tight.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I finally... get to see you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m so glad you’re safe...”[%p]
I could feel her warmth.[%p]
Mayuri was here.[%p]
I’d never gone almost a whole month without seeing her before.[%p]
And this was wartime. I couldn’t easily contact her like I could in the old worldline.[%p]
So I’d been so worried about whether or not Mayuri was okay.[%p]
It was no exaggeration to say that I’d survived this far just to make sure.[%p]
I’d erased the entire Alpha worldline to save her.[%p]
No matter what happened, I wanted her to be safe.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... you’re hurting me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, sorry.”[%p]
I’d held her too closely.[%p]
I took a step back.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii believed, you know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii believed she’d get to see Okarin again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hooray! You’re safe, nya!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san!”[%p]
I heard two more voices I recognized.[%p]
Faris and Luka, and behind them I saw Kaede.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m glad you’re all safe...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san, I... I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
I felt myself getting choked up, too, when I saw Lukako cry.[%p]
I exchanged greetings with Kaede, too. Fubuki had grabbed on to her like a little kid. She was still pale and trembling.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris... I guess you’re not wearing your maid outfit for once.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s been a long time since anybody’s called me Faris, nya.”[%p]
Faris spoke sadly. Then she put her hand around my neck and held me close. Her little pink lips got close to my ear, as if she was about to kiss me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-Hey...”[%p]
What was going on?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hahaha, don’t be so embarrassed, nyan.”[%p]
She laughed mischievously. Then Faris, no, Akiha Rumiho, whispered into my ear while pretending to kiss me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Be careful. Don’t trust the Ministry of Defense or the Americans.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Adults are all liars. None of them tell the truth.”[%p]
That’s right. Faris had a special talent.[%p]
[color index="280AA02D1400"]Cheshire[color index="800000"] Break.[%p]
She was incredibly good at looking into someone’s heart and seeing what they were thinking.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. I just figured that out.”[%p]
One of them just tricked me.[%p]
Faris looked surprised and took a step back.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That’s sad, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
And then I heard the sound of another engine.[%p]
This time it was coming from beyond the gate, and inside the base.[%p]
It belonged to a black luxury car with an E on the license plate. Behind it was a minibus.[%p]
The two of them stopped in front of the gate.[%p]
It was time for my reunion to end.[%p]
[name]US military personnel[line]“Welcome!”[%p]
An American soldier as tall as a basketball player got out of the car.[%p]
[name]US military personnel[line]“Welcome, everyone. My name is Hammond.”[%p]
His Japanese was good, but not great.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“Everyone except Mister Okabe, please get on the bus.”[%p]
He was smiling, but I could tell he wasn’t going to allow any arguments.[%p]
And the other American soldiers were still carrying their rifles, as they stood guard without smiles.[%p]
Shimoyama and the other Japanese soldiers were watching us from a distance. They didn’t try to stop us. They were just looking downward.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? Everyone but Okarin? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“There’s no need to be scared. We’re just going to talk to you a little, and then we’ll send you right to the Okinawa Defense Bureau! Come along.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s fine. Don’t worry.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yuki-san, take care of Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Okay.”[%p]
Yuki nodded and put her arm around Mayuri’s shoulder as she led her to the bus. Everyone else followed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tell my parents I said hi.”[%p]
Once everyone but me was on, the minibus left immediately.[%p]
The area in front of the gate fell silent.[%p]
It was hard to believe this existed in the same world as all the places I’d crossed on my escape through Japan’s main island.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“All right, Mister Okabe. Come this way.”[%p]
He told me to get in the back seat of the black luxury car.[%p]
What would happen to me once I got inside?[%p]
I tried to think about it, but realized there was nothing I could do. I was just about to get into the car when—[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Okabe-kun, run! If you go to America you won’t come back alive—”[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Shimoyama’s scream was cut off by the sound of gunfire.[%p]
In the corner of my eye I saw the American soldiers firing without hesitation.[%p]
No way...[%p]
I tried to turn around, when—[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“Get inside.”[%p]
A large hand blocked my vision as Hammond held me down.[%p]
I couldn’t hear Shimoyama’s voice anymore.[%p]
Through the gaps between his fingers I could see that nothing was moving.[%p]
And I knew exactly what that meant.[%p]
I was shoved into the car before I had time to think about it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is—”[%p]
I tried to open my mouth, but Hammond looked into my eyes and shook his head.[%p]
I wasn’t supposed to talk, then.[%p]
Hammond sat next to me, then closed the door. The car started to move.[%p]
Soon, we turned down a different road than the one the minibus was taking.[%p]
America, huh?[%p]
I’d never been there before.[%p]
What were they going to do to me there?[%p]
Use me as a guinea pig? Cut open my head and dissect my brain?[%p]
I probably wasn’t going to be able to do any tourist things.[%p]
I felt like screaming, but tried my best to stay calm.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“There’s someone I want you to meet.”[%p]
Hammond suddenly spoke. Then he handed me something.[%p]
I took it before I even looked at what it was. When I checked, it was a normal smartphone.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“It’s not locked. Just hit that button.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
Confused, I pressed the button as I was told.[%p]
And then something appeared on the screen—[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“[Kurisu]...!”[%p]
It was the Amadeus Makise Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why does the US military have Amadeus?”[%p]
I was about to ask Hammond when...[%p]
For the first time in about a month, that feeling came back.[%p]
