The sky was red-black, dotted with columns of thick black smoke.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There was so much rubble I couldn’t find a place to stand.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Screams. Gunshots.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And the stench.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Everyone in this world knew what this smell was.[%p]
It was the smell of burning.[%e]
Houses. Buildings. Cars. Motorcycles. Trees. Grass.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And humans.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was the smell of all of them burning together.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Something thin and black poked from between piles of rubble.[%p]
It was a hand.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The hand, unmoving, stretched up toward the sky.[%e]
No, that wasn’t the only one.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Everywhere I looked, I saw hands, legs, and heads.[%p]
Parts of what were once human beings were strewn across the ground.[%p]
[margin top="38"]I heard a distant gunshot.[%e]
A shout.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Silence.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Nothing changed.[%p]
Just one more body lying on the ground.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The world was ending.[%e]
And at last people understood.[%p]
This wasn’t the afterlife.[%p]
This was the real world.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Hell.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Yes, that’s what this was. This was Hell.[%e]
