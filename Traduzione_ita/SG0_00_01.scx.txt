The hatch opened.[%p]
Bright light flooded my eyes.[%p]
Where was I?[%p]
My eyes narrowed.[%p]
I could barely make out the summer’s twilight sky.[%p]
I didn’t want to leave.[%p]
I just wanted to disappear.[%p]
But...[%p]
Someone grabbed my arm and dragged me out.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, you’re already back! It hasn’t even been a minute.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Okarin?”[%p]
I didn’t have the energy to respond to my own nickname.[%p]
I fell to the ground and wrapped my arms around myself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
Mayuri rushed over to me. She looked at my face in concern.[%p]
But even her concern was too much for me to bear.[%p]
Please, don’t talk to me.[%p]
Just leave me alone.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, you’re covered in blood! What happened?!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Get him a towel, Dad! And water! And some clothes, too! Hurry!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Huh?! An explanation, por favor!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Just go already!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“O-Okay!”[%p]
Daru ran back inside the building.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you okay? Hang in there... don’t die...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He’s okay. It’s not his blood.”[%p]
Stop it.[%p]
Just get away from me.[%p]
Leave me alone.[%p]
I couldn’t save her.[%p]
Not only that. I took her life with my own two hands.[%p]
Three weeks ago, in this very spot.[%p]
I killed her.[%p]
I murdered her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no way to save her... there never was...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahaha... Everything has already been decided...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same...”[%p]
No matter how many times I try, the result will converge on Kurisu’s death.[%p]
The cause doesn’t matter.[%p]
It doesn’t matter if I time leap, or if I time travel. Going to the past can’t change the result.[%p]
I thought I understood that cruel truth...[%p]
But now, I was forced to realize it again, and in the worst possible way.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t take this anymore... I’m so tired... enough already... I give up...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haha, ha...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... what happened?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... I killed her. I killed her. I’m an idiot. It’s all my fault.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He k-killed Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Killed? That can’t be true... It can’t...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t worry. You’ve got enough for one more attempt.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just leave me alone... No matter how many times I try, it’ll all end up the same.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What are you saying?! Are you going to give up?!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Billions of lives depend on you, Uncle Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Who cares if you fail once?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s just no way to save Kurisu! You can’t stop the [color index="280AA02D1400"]worldline[color index="800000"] convergence...”[%p]
That’s the reality of this world.[%p]
I learned that a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Grr...! I’ll just have to slap some sense into him—”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You can’t! It’s not right to force him to do this...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t bear to see Okarin like this...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If he doesn’t, the future won’t change!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why? Why does Okarin have to change the future all by himself?!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s too much for him to bear...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Because only Uncle Okarin has the powers of an observer of the world.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin didn’t want that!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And I think even if he tried, he’d just get hurt again...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s impossible for one person to change the world all by themselves.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And that’s why Steins Gate is...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I know how you feel. But I’m here for the sake of the future.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I can’t go back to 2036 either way, so I’m not going to give up so easily.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle Okarin, I’ll tell you one thing. This time machine has a finite amount of fuel.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“At first, I told you that it could only be used to go there and back twice, but there’s actually a little more fuel than that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Even so, it can only travel about 344 days.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Even if you do a one-way trip, less than a year from now you won’t be able to reach July 28th.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Remember this. When that day comes, I’ll go myself if I must.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Someone was saying something to me.[%p]
But I couldn’t understand the words.[%p]
I didn’t want to listen to anything. I just wanted to sleep.[%p]
Just let this all end...[%p]
Just let me go...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... Hey, Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to push yourself so hard anymore, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s okay to cry, Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii is here for you. Okay, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I don’t know if Mayuri’s words were the reason why, but...[%p]
The tears started to flow.[%p]
I decided to forget everything.[%p]
Ever since that day, I stopped going to the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Future Gadget Lab[color index="800000"].[%p]
