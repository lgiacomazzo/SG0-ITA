Several days passed, and I still had no idea who had planted the memories in Kagari’s head.[%p]
I went all the way out to talk to the priest who’d found her, and even questioned the locals in the surrounding area, but I had no luck.[%p]
Suzuha seemed to be doing her own research. She hadn’t been back to the lab since then. She was in touch with Daru at regular intervals, so I didn’t think she was in danger.[%p]
I asked Tennouji and Moeka again, but neither of them seemed to have any luck.[%p]
In this linea di universo, the lab hadn’t even been attacked.[%p]
Which meant they might be up to something else.[%p]
Even if they were, I had no way of even imagining what it was.[%p]
But I was sure that someone had kidnapped a young Shiina Kagari and experimented on her, and only recently had she escaped.[%p]
They had to be planning something, and I was sure it was bad.[%p]
We didn’t have time to wait for them to act.[%p]
But without any clues, there was nothing we could do.[%p]
My mind kept going in circles, and I kept getting more frustrated and nervous with every minute.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sorry to make you do all this for me, Maho-senpai.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No. It’s almost done. And I’m doing it for me, too.”[%p]
Maho staggered out of the development room, sank into the sofa, and smiled sleepily.[%p]
There were dark spots under her eyes.[%p]
For the last few days, she’d been working on the device without any sleep.[%p]
Her work needed to pay off soon, as fast as possible.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Anyway, I never would’ve come up with the idea of using a cell phone. And even if I had, I never would’ve actually tried it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When you’re talking on a cell phone, you always need to put it up to your temples, you know?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s where the frontal and lobo temporales are.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“If you consider that the giro paraippocampale in the lobo temporale is where memories are stored, it makes sense, I think.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The question is how we compress the memories, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m working day and night to make that happen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, Daru.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And you absolutely insisted that I not let them find out that I’m hacking in from this lab, so it’s extra-hard. I’ve got other work to do too, you know.”[%p]
To compress the memories, we needed SERN’s [color index="280AA02D1400"]LHC[color index="800000"], no matter what.[%p]
That one took a lot of thought.[%p]
If we made an enemy out of SERN, that tragedy I’d gone through before would repeat.[%p]
But the main reason that SERN had attacked us was the D-Mails we’d sent to the past.[%p]
If it weren’t for that, they probably wouldn’t have bothered.[%p]
And since we weren’t sending D-Mails, SERN would probably never even detect us. Probably.[%p]
Fortunately, Suzuha had the IBN 5100 that we needed for the hack.[%p]
Things were coming together better than I’d expected.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know, Okarin, she’s almost a completely different person now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right...”[%p]
I nodded at Daru.[%p]
For the past few days, more of Kurisu’s memories had been invading Kagari’s mind.[%p]
Lately, she’d even started discussing complex technical subjects with Maho.[%p]
She was acting just like Kurisu used to when she lived in America.[%p]
At first, Maho seemed put off, but she eventually adapted.[%p]
Maho probably wanted to get details about the device from Kurisu, so it seemed to be helping.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You know, even after seeing the time machine, I still can’t believe you made the Time Leap Machine in a lab like this.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The idea of digitizing human memories and sending them to the past is an amazing one. You’re brilliant, Maho-senpai.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’ll say the exact same thing to you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re a genius, and in the end, I’m just Salieri.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...?”[%p]
Watching the two of them, it was easy to fool myself into thinking that it was Maho and Kurisu talking.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, right. I wanted to ask about Amadeus. What happened to the project?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Unfortunately, it was shut down.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Shut down? Why? Did Dr. Leskinen decide to do that?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t know. The professor said the orders came from higher up.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But it was going so well!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yes?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“H-Huh? What was I just—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re Kagari. Shiina Kagari, right?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Shiina Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s right. I’m Shiina Kagari. I’m...”[%p]
Kagari suddenly put her hands up to her head, afraid.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But then... What are these memories in my head?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’re Makise Kurisu’s memories. Not yours.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t know what that means!”[%p]
Kagari was acting completely different now than she was just a moment ago with Maho. She raised her voice like a child throwing a tantrum.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“To me, these are all my memories!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“My memories with Mommy Mayuri, and my memories with my dad when I was a kid, and then my memories of the college in America are all inside me.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t know which are real, and which are fake...”[%p]
Her words turned to sobs.[%p]
I could understand how she felt. From her perspective, it was all real.[%p]
None of it was fake.[%p]
It was easy to tell her to get a hold of herself.[%p]
But it wasn’t that easy for her to actually do it.[%p]
I remembered what Kurisu had said when she’d finished the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
She’d said you could never put your memories inside someone else’s mind.[%p]
It would destroy their personality.[%p]
But if...[%p]
Just if...[%p]
If we were to leave Kagari like this, what would happen?[%p]
There was a chance that her own memories would disappear and only Kurisu’s would remain.[%p]
If that happened, who would the person in front of me become?[%p]
Would they be Kagari?[%p]
Or would they be Kurisu?[%p]
If it was Kurisu...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
That wasn’t true.[%p]
It was impossible.[%p]
I couldn’t even think about it.[%p]
But the more I thought, the more I felt a horrible idea tugging at my mind, no matter how much I tried to ignore it.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Tell me... What am I supposed to do? Save me... Mommy... Daddy...”[%p]
It would’ve been great if Mayuri was around.[%p]
But unfortunately, both she and Lukako had gone to school.[%p]
Both of them were worried about Kagari, and had told me to contact them if anything came up, but that didn’t mean I could rely on them all the time.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Kagari-tan, why not go for a walk to get your mind off things?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. Humans have a tendency to overthink things when they’re sitting still. It might be better to move around a little.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...Okay.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“All right, Okarin. Take care of Kagari-tan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Okay.”[%p]
The two of us walked out to Chuo-dori together, but we didn’t really have anything to do.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
The air outside must’ve made her feel a little better, because Kagari was starting to calm down.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So... Is there someplace you’d like to go?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Can I go anywhere I want to?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, anywhere you want.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Then take me somewhere you went with Kurisu-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Take me someplace you went with Kurisu-san, Okarin-san.”[%p]
Somewhere I’d been with Kurisu...[%p]
Where could that be?[%p]
The coin laundry in the neighborhood?[%p]
Horin Park?[%p]
Sanbo’s beef bowl?[%p]
I hadn’t spent a lot of time with her at fun or romantic places.[%p]
I’d spent a lot of time with her, but most of it had disappeared into many different le linee di universo.[%p]
I’d gone through that time again and again.[%p]
But most of it had been spent arguing and working with her at the lab.[%p]
We’d never spent any time going places to have fun.[%p]
And we’d never made it to Aomori, either.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Where did you first meet Kurisu-san, Okarin-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where we first met...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s where I want to go.”[%p]
The place where Kurisu and I had met.[%p]
It was—[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Is this it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
A brightly-colored building in front of Akihabara Station—Radi-Kan.[%p]
—This was where it started.[%p]
Yes, this is where everything had begun.[%p]
On that day, the time machine appeared on the roof of the building.[%p]
It was just after that when I met Kurisu.[%p]
I could still remember it.[%p]
The challenging look in her eyes.[%p]
Thinking back, I may have already fallen in love with her then.[%p]
But even though this was the place I’d met her, this was also the place where—[%p]
Where I’d—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san? What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-Sorry.”[%p]
Lately I’d been so busy with Kagari that I’d started to think I was getting a little better... But maybe I wasn’t.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You’re really sweating. I’m sorry. Is this my fault?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not it. It’s just...”[%p]
Whenever I came here, I couldn’t help but remember...[%p]
What happened that day.[%p]
But...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“L-Let’s go.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You’re sure? You’re not feeling good, are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine.”[%p]
I couldn’t just stand out here forever.[%p]
I couldn’t keep Mayuri, Daru, and the others worrying forever.[%p]
If I needed to get over it at some point, then—[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“All right. Let’s go.”[%p]
Something soft touched my hand.[%p]
Kagari was holding my hand tightly in hers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank you...”[%p]
Kagari lead me down the bustling street toward Radi-Kan. My knees felt like they were about to give out at any second.[%p]
Even after I’d gone inside, I was still doing better than I had thought I would.[%p]
But I still didn’t feel like climbing the stairs where it had happened.[%p]
We took the elevator to the roof.[%p]
Faris, aka Akiha Rumiho, had carefully locked the door to the roof so that no one who wasn’t authorized could enter.[%p]
I’d been given a key, too, but today was the first time I was able to use it.[%p]
The first thing I saw after coming onto the roof was a strangely-shaped object. The time machine.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow, I remember this! I came here in this thing!”[%p]
Kagari happily ran up to the time machine.[%p]
It was right after she’d separated from Suzuha that she’d lost her memories.[%p]
She remembered going from the future to this place in 1975.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The first time I came outside here, I was amazed at how pretty the sky was.”[%p]
Unfortunately, it wasn’t very pretty right now.[%p]
But Kagari spoke as if there was an endless blue sky stretching out in front of us.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I didn’t want to leave Mommy, so I stayed inside the machine and cried. I missed her so much.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But Suzuha told me that I had to stop crying, and I couldn’t be like that anymore. But I was still so sad...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And then the hatch opened, and I saw the blue sky.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The sky in 2036 isn’t blue?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah. The war made it all black and dark, and they wouldn’t let me go outside very much.”[%p]
The mid-70s were right after the big economic growth spurt. Ecological concerns weren’t as important as they are now.[%p]
That was also when air pollution was a really big deal.[%p]
The air probably wasn’t as clean as it is now.[%p]
If it seemed beautiful to her anyway, that must have meant the air in the future was really terrible.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san, is this where you first met Kurisu-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, this isn’t it. This is—”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ah...”[%p]
A cold drop hit my nose.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It’s started to rain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, you’re right.”[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Okabe?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re alive...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Right. I forgot I might run into you here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What were you doing?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Thinking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...”[%p]
The rain had been falling then, too.[%p]
When she’d learned that either she or Mayuri was fated to die, she’d come here and looked up at the sky like this.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uwah!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I-It’s really pouring! Okarin-san, get inside!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san?”[%p]
What had she been thinking then?[%p]
When she’d entrusted her fate to another person—to me.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san! You’re going to catch a cold! Hurry!”[%p]
Kagari dragged me inside, away from the noise of the falling rain.[%p]
A few moments later, I found myself sitting there.[%p]
The place was being renovated and none of the stores were open. The lights were off, too, and it made the place seem very gloomy.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow, that really surprised me.”[%p]
That day, after the rain, Kurisu and I had leaned up against each other and talked.[%p]
And this was also the place where—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is it.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is where I met Kurisu.”[%p]
Strictly speaking, this is where I’d first met her in the linea di universo Beta.[%p]
That day, half a year ago...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What were you trying to tell me earlier?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really sad.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You looked like you were going to start crying any second.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why? Have we met before?”[%p]
Thinking back, that was the beginning of everything.[%p]
I wished I’d never met her.[%p]
If only I’d have known this would be the result...[%p]
If I’d never met her, I wouldn’t have to feel this way...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san...”[%p]
I felt something soft touch my face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mommy used to do this whenever I was scared.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You looked like you were going to start crying any second.”[%p]
Kagari patted me on the head again and again, as if I were a child.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is where I first met Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Here on the landing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. She left a terrible first impression. The first time she met me, she was arrogant and spent a lot of time glaring at me. Not cute at all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course, she probably felt the same way about me.”[%p]
After all, at the time I was rambling about nonsense like Organization agents.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But... she still ended up being someone you cared about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
That was in the linea di universo Alfa, though.[%p]
Right after I’d met Kurisu in this one, she’d...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“My face looks a lot like Kurisu-san’s, doesn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How did you know?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Senpa—Maho-san told me so.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And so I looked it up on the internet, and I was amazed.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Maybe it’s fate that her memories are inside me.”[%p]
Fate—[%p]
It always was.[%p]
Fate laughed at us.[%p]
It toyed with us.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hey, just hypothetically...”[%p]
A drop of rain ran down Kagari’s hair and hit the floor.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“If I were to lose my memories as Shiina Kagari, and they were all replaced with the memories of Kurisu-san...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Would I turn into Makise Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not that simple.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But what if it were? If that happened... would you be happy?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“If I became Kurisu-san, would it make you happy?”[%p]
It was the voice of the demon I’d tried so many times to ignore.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
I didn’t want that...[%p]
Or did I?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But I wouldn’t like that, though.”[%p]
Another drop of rain struck the floor.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t want to disappear, not knowing why I was ever alive, not being of any use to anybody.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What’s going to happen to me? I... I...”[%p]
Kagari was shaking a little.[%p]
It wasn’t just because of the cold.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No...”[%p]
I never did figure out what she was apologizing for.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re going to catch a cold. Let’s go home.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“J-Just come in.”[%p]
The first time I went into Lukako’s room... It really did look like a girl’s room.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, you’re both soaked. You’d better hurry and change.”[%p]
Yanabayashi Shrine was closer to Radi-Kan than the lab.[%p]
So I’d decided to bring Kagari there.[%p]
Mayuri had sent me a message on the way, so I had her come here first.[%p]
I figured that Kagari needed Mommy Mayuri right now more than she needed me.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mommy...”[%p]
Just like I thought, the second she saw Mayuri’s face she relaxed a little.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You must’ve been so cold, right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ll get a bath ready.”[%p]
Lukako handed us towels to wipe away the rain, and ran out of the room to start the bath.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I want to take a bath with you, Mommy.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“With Mayushii? Sure, okay. But what will you do, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, I’m fine. You guys can go first.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay, thanks. Make sure you change so you don’t catch a cold, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um... I’ll work something out.”[%p]
Maybe I could borrow Lukako’s father’s clothes?[%p]
Just as I got up to leave the room—[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari...chan?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s wrong, Kagari-chan?”[%p]
Something was wrong with Kagari.[%p]
She was staring at Mayuri’s face, confused.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Who are you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Who are you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s me, Mayushii, Kagari-chan.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Kagari... My name?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No... I’m... I’m...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Who? Who am I? I’m...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uh...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uwah... AAAHH!!”[%p]
Kagari tore at her hair and let loose a cry that sounded like it came from the pits of hell.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Get a hold of yourself, Kagari!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Aaaah! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts so much!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It hurts... It hurts, Mommy! Help me... Help me, Daddy!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Someone save me... Save me!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Someone save me...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan!”[%p]
She was a like a puppet whose strings had been cut.[%p]
All the strength left her body, and she fell forward—[%p]
By the time I left Lukako’s house, the rain had stopped.[%p]
We waited for a while after that, but Kagari showed no signs of waking up.[%p]
She looked peaceful as she was sleeping, so I decided to leave her to Mayuri and Lukako, and head back to the lab.[%p]
According to the two of them, she’d gotten confused several times in the past.[%p]
But never like this.[%p]
We might have underestimated how dangerous her situation really was.[%p]
Her brain was probably under a lot of stress already.[%p]
We needed a way to deal with this, and now.[%p]
But for that—[%p]
[name]Itaru & Maho[line]“Got it!”[linebreak][parallel]“I did it!”[%p]
The second I opened the door, I heard Daru and Maho yelling.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“R-Really?”[%p]
I ran inside without even taking the time to remove my shoes.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh? Okarin, perfect timing!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san, you’re soaked!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That doesn’t matter! Did you guys pull it off?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mhmm!”[%p]
Daru gave me a thumbs up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nice work, Daru!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m a super hacker. This is nothing.”[%p]
He could say that, but I knew exactly how much talent and effort it took to hack SERN.[%p]
Your average hacker couldn’t do it.[%p]
The name “super hacker” wasn’t just for show.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about you, Hiyajo-san? Were you successful, too?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m pretty good at my job, too, you know.”[%p]
Maho stuck her thumb up just like Daru had.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wow...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Well, this was all thanks to the information you and Kagari-san gave me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In that sense, we were lucky that she had Kurisu’s memories.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, you were the one who did the work.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thanks. I’ll just accept the compliment.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Now the question is whether it works... And the only way to find out is to try it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I want three trips to [color index="280AA02D1400"]Kitchen Jiro[color index="800000"].”[%p]
Sure thing.[%p]
Anyway, everything was ready.[%p]
All that was left was to find out who they were.[%p]
But that was still the biggest problem.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Whew... Okay, I’m going to get some rest. I’m pretty tired—”[%p]
The sound of a ringing phone cut her off.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Jeez, who is it? I’m about to go to sleep...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yes, hello?”[%p]
She muttered to herself as she took the phone to the back of the development room.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So, how’s Kagari-tan doing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“About that...”[%p]
Just as I spoke, a RINE message arrived.[%p]
It was from Lukako.[%p]
I let out a small sigh of relief and sent back an answer.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not good, actually. She forgot who Mayuri was today.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not all. Right after that she started complaining about a horrible headache and passed out.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s bad, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It is. We need to do something.”[%p]
But unless we knew who we were up against, there was nothing we could do.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What? You’re sure?”[%p]
Daru and I exchanged glances at the sudden voice from the development room.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maho-tan, what’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did something happen?”[%p]
When we looked inside, Maho turned around in a state of shock.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Someone ransacked my hotel room...”[%p]
The call was from the hotel.[%p]
Maho was staying at a business hotel in Wako City.[%p]
Some time in the past few days while she’d been staying here, someone had ransacked it.[%p]
She’d left her keycard with the front desk, but there were signs that the lock had been picked. She’d just given her okay to search the room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So? Did they find anything?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“They’re just about to call the police, and they want me to come back and see if anything’s been stolen.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Th-Then they don’t know what was taken? M-M-Maybe they stole your underwear?!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I brought all that with me! Do you want me to sue you for sexual harassment?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh... Please don’t.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“My room’s always a mess anyway, so it’s possible that it just looked like someone ransacked it. If I wanted to be optimistic, that is.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“They said the lock was forced, so it’s almost certain that someone broke in.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Actually, the same thing happened to the office not too long ago.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then it’s not just a coincidence. Someone is after something you’ve got.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. And I think I know what it is.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kurisu’s laptop.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That...”[%p]
Putting all the pieces together, it seemed the most likely option.[%p]
I could be sure that whoever tried to overwrite Kagari’s memories was the same group that attacked her in the other linea di universo.[%p]
Whoever those people were, they were after the time machine theory hidden in Kurisu’s memories.[%p]
But since their experiment had failed and Kagari had escaped, they’d turned their attention to the other thing Kurisu had left behind.[%p]
The laptop and hard drive that Maho had.[%p]
But if they were after that... Did that mean they had it now?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, is that computer the one you gave me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I really wanted to crack the password, so once I started staying here, I gave it to Hashida-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then the laptop...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It should be safe. Right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yup. It’s in my secret hideout right now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But since I’ve been so busy with hacking SERN, I haven’t had time to analyze it.”[%p]
That made me feel a lot better.[%p]
Now if only we knew who had broken into her room... But it wouldn’t be that easy.[%p]
Still, if they’d done something like that, they must be starting to panic.[%p]
What would they do next?[%p]
...Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We may be able to use this.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Use it?”[%p]
I didn’t want to waste time explaining, so I just took out my phone and made the call.[%p]
Several days later—[%p]
Kagari’s condition was getting worse.[%p]
