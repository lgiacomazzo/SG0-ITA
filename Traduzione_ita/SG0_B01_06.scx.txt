[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’m telling you, don’t talk to me, talk to Maho-senpai!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What is wrong with you?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Ha...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Fine, fine.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“M-Merry Christmas...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“A-Are you satisfied? Bye.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Right, right. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hey, is that your present? What did you get? Tell me.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Wait. Why are you looking away?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Did you get something you can’t tell me about?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hmm... Something you can’t tell me about...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“No, I wasn’t imagining anything involving hentai!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Really! And I’m definitely not turning red!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’m hanging up!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Do you want a Christmas present from me?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to be the only one giving a present, though. If you give me something, I might think about it.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What do I want? Hmm...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“No, never mind.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Just the fact that you’re talking to me like this is enough of a present.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Sorry, I think I just said something really embarrassing. Forget it.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“It’s really sad the way you keep hitting an AI up for a present.”[%p]
...I’m not going to talk to [Kurisu] right now.[%p]
The lab was filled with Santas, just like I’d heard on the phone.[%p]
And all of them were wearing miniskirts.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, it’s Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“He’s here, nya!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Everything’s ready.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Hey there. Merry Christmas!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Good evening, Okarin-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-Hi...”[%p]
The sight of so many girls in a small room like this, all wearing Santa miniskirts, threatened to overwhelm me.[%p]
I was having trouble deciding where to look when Lukako staggered in front of me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
W-What are you wearing, man?[%p]
I didn’t expect a Santa in black.[%p]
And wasn’t he exposing an awful lot of skin?[%p]
It was really... erotic...[%p]
B-But he’s a guy![%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... I... I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, um... I’m glad you survived.”[%p]
It must’ve been hard being the only guy.[%p]
I gave him a pat on the shoulder and he smiled, relieved.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I wanted to wear a Santa outfit, too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay! Next year, I’ll make one for you, too!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Really?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Thanks, Big Sis Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Heheheh!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay, Okarin! Come in, come in!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are Daru and Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No word yet.”[%p]
The biggest goal today was to get Suzuha to participate. It was no exaggeration to say that that’s why Mayuri had held this party.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“By the way, who are your guests?”[%p]
I’d told them earlier that I was bringing Dr. Leskinen and Maho.[%p]
I brought the two of them inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll introduce you. This is Dr. Leskinen.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Merry Christmas!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fweeh...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Wow!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Ooh!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Oh my!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“He’s big!”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Thank you, cute little lady.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“But Daddy’s bigger.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um... and this is Hiyajo Maho-san.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hi. Nice to meet you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fweeh...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Wow!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Ooh!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Oh my!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Maho-nyan, we meet again!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, it’s the NyanNyan girl...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Are you in elementary school? Middle school?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m actually a grown-up.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Um... S-Sorry.”[%p]
Maho’s smile froze on her face.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Mayuri-chan, what do you think?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They’re both perfect! Mayushii’s thinking up all kinds of delusions!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I should’ve gotten some smaller sizes ready. Nae-chan could’ve worn one, too. It’s the biggest mistake in Mayushii’s life!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I would’ve wanted to see the two of them as little Santas.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
Mayuri had her in her sights, then.[%p]
There was no escape for Maho now. Mayuri was so stubborn, she’d even managed to convince the legendarily shy Lukako.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“What about the professor?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ve never made an outfit for someone that tall.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Just having him there would guarantee a win, though.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe a fluffy reindeer outfit? With a red nose?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“U-Um... Maybe? Maybe not?”[%p]
Wait, were they seriously going to dress the professor up as a reindeer?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Mayuri? You shouldn’t assume that everyone will understand your cosplay hobby.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, um, that’s right. It’s not good to force people.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But lately even the employees at the convenience stores dress up as Santa for Christmas.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Christmas and ComiMa are two very different things, aren’t they?”[%p]
Or so you say, but basically you want to dress the two of them up in Santa outfits, don’t you?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, Maho-san, do you want Mayushii to lend you a Santa outfit?”[%p]
Mayuri was already going after her.[%p]
Maho refused as forcefully as she could, but Dr. Leskinen was surprisingly interested. He had been trying to put on a triangular paper party hat.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, I just got a message from Daru-kun.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He’s almost here. And Suzu-san’s with him.”[%p]
Mayuri was looking at her smartphone.[%p]
It looked like Daru had pulled it off.[%p]
I guess he really was Suzuha’s dad.[%p]
This meant we’d succeeded in our biggest objective.[%p]
Which meant it was on to the next mission.[%p]
We’d all decided that we were going to surprise Suzuha.[%p]
Suzuha didn’t know that we were all waiting for her.[%p]
We each grabbed a noisemaker and got into position.[%p]
Dr. Leskinen and Maho helped, too.[%p]
Maho seemed unsure, but Dr. Leskinen was more than willing to participate.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m turning off the lights, nya!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wonder if Suzu-san will like it.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You never get to see Suzuha-san look surprised.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But she actually really likes sweets, nya!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“And she’s really nice.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“When I said ‘Hi!’ a little while ago, she said ‘Hi!’ back!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Yeah? I wish I could get along with her, too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You will. It’ll be fine. You two are perfect for each other.”[%p]
And then we heard Daru’s voice from outside the window, in the alley below the building.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okay, I’m going inside!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m going inside, with Suzuha!”[%p]
His voice was loud, and unnaturally expository.[%p]
Once he got below the lab, he was supposed to give a signal. Everything was going as planned.[%p]
We all went “Ssh!” at each other in the darkness.[%p]
I could hear two sets of footsteps coming up the stairs.[%p]
Everyone held their breath and waited.[%p]
The timing was critical.[%p]
But would she be able to figure it out before we acted?[%p]
The room was filled with different smells, like the girls’ perfume and the aroma of the food they’d made.[%p]
Didn’t Suzuha always notice these things more quickly than an ordinary person would?[%p]
I started to get worried.[%p]
And then I heard the sound of the front door opening.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? Nobody’s here today, then?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-Well, some days are like that.”[%p]
Daru, you idiot, your voice is shaking![%p]
I got even more nervous.[%p]
Was it time yet? Where was the signal?[%p]
I felt like my hands were going to slip and trigger the noisemaker too early.[%p]
My palms were soaked with sweat.[%p]
I could tell Suzuha was taking off her shoes.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Now, nya!”[%p]
Faris gave the signal.[%p]
The second the lights went on, we all activated our noisemakers.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“—?!”[%p]
I could see Suzuha flinch for just an instant.[%p]
But I couldn’t follow what happened after that.[%p]
That’s how fast she was.[%p]
She dropped down, sprung off the floor, and leapt toward Yuki, who happened to be standing in front of her.[%p]
She might have broken Yuki’s jaw with the base of her palm before I could shout at her to stop.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Kyah!”[%p]
Fortunately, Yuki had been surprised by Suzuha’s sudden charge, and had slipped when she’d tried to step back.[%p]
Because of this, Suzuha’s palm barely missed Yuki’s nose as it sliced through the air.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-Stop it, Suzuha!”[%p]
By the time I’d finally shouted, it was all over.[%p]
Suzuha had grabbed Yuki before she fell down and was holding her up.[%p]
Yuki, Suzuha, and all the rest of us were too stunned to speak.[%p]
That was close.[%p]
If the timing of events had been even slightly different, Yuki could have been badly hurt.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“S-Stop, nya!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“M-Merry Christmas!”[%p]
Everyone finally realized what had happened and began to panic.[%p]
Yuki simply lay in Suzuha’s arms, blinking her eyes.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“W-What are you doing...?”[%p]
Suzuha seemed to snap back to reality. She was looking around at everyone.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I said Merry Christmas, Suzu-san!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Merry Christmas?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“W-Wow... That scared me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Those were amazing moves.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It was too fast for me to follow...”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Yuki-san, are you okay?”[%p]
Suzuha was looking around the room.[%p]
Did she still not understand what was going on?[%p]
Did she not realize it was a party, since she’d never been to one before?[%p]
The walls and ceiling were covered in wreaths and ribbons.[%p]
There was a folding table filled with food, cakes, snacks and drinks.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A party?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I-I’m sorry. It was my idea to make it a surprise.”[%p]
Yuki backed away from Suzuha and started to bow apologetically.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“S-Suzuha, this is, um... We wanted to make it a surprise! We didn’t mean to scare you!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“S-Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Da... Brother, did you know about this?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Y-Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I see. That’s why you were acting kind of weird today.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sorry, Suzu-san! It was Mayushii who planned it all. So don’t get mad at Yuki-san or Daru-kun! Get mad at Mayushii!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, come on, Big Sis Mayu. Do I always get mad like that?”[%p]
Suzuha looked around the room again.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hmm... Wow. It’s hard to believe this is the same lab.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Right? We all decorated it together!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah, it’s really amazing. It’s pretty.”[%p]
Suzuha laughed halfheartedly and began backing toward the door.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“W-Where are you going?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? Where...? You guys are having a party, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t want to get in the way. Come on, Brother. You know I don’t belong in a place like this.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Th-That’s not true, nyan! Let’s all have a party together, nya!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? But I... I’ve never done this stuff before.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You just have fun and eat food and talk! So... Come on, okay?”[%p]
Mayuri grabbed Suzuha’s hand, tightly, to keep her from getting away.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“B-Big Sis Mayu?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Come on, we’ve got a seat for you too, Suzuha.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But... I really don’t know what to do.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Just sit down, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri half-dragged Suzuha over to the seat next to me, and forced her to sit down.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Okay, everykitty! The gang’s all here now, nya!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Round of applause, everyone!”[%p]
Everybody started to applaud at Fubuki’s signal.[%p]
Daru played some Christmas carols on the computer.[%p]
The grim atmosphere that had begun to fill the room was banished. I felt a little relieved.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Okay, let’s start with a toast, nyan! Pour your favorite drink into your glass, nya!”[%p]
Everybody started to look at the various drinks on the table.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Here, Suzuha.”[%p]
Suzuha still looked like she was feeling as though she didn’t belong, so I poured her some non-alcoholic champagne.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“O-Oh. Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I really don’t think I can do this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Because... I didn’t come to this era to play.”[%p]
The reason she came to this era, huh?[%p]
I didn’t have the right to say anything about that.[%p]
I was the only reason that she was stuck here, unable to fulfill her task.[%p]
But even so...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it so bad to do this, once in a while?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Suzuha, you think too much.”[%p]
Daru joined the conversation.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“All you’re doing is having a meal with everyone. You’re hungry either way, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well...”[%p]
Maybe Daru’s statement caused her to realize it, because her stomach rumbled.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uh...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“See?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Everybody made a lot of food for you, so just say thanks and eat it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Everybody, you all got your drinks ready, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“All right, let’s have a word from Mayushii, who put this party together, nya!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? Huh?!”[%p]
Mayuri stood up, flustered.[%p]
As she stood, she bumped into Lukako, who was standing next to her. The two of them almost spilled their drinks.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“W-Wah! Sorry, Luka-kun!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Mayuri-chan, calm down.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay...”[%p]
Mayuri started to take deep breaths.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... It’s Christmas Eve today.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There’s i normie out everywhere today, but this year, let’s have a party and be dei normie ourselves!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“No, um... I don’t think that’s what ‘normie’ means, Mayushii...”[%p]
Fubuki whispered, a little sad.[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“A bunch of people asked Fubuki-chan out on Christmas dates! You should’ve seen them all!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“They were all younger girls, though.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... um... anyway, if everybody has a good time, Mayushii will be happy.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s all.”[%p]
Mayuri gave a little bow, and smiled to Suzuha.[%p]
Suzuha answered with an expression that wasn’t quite a smile.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Okay, everybody! Cheers, nya! Maho-nyan, you give the toast!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Wha—Me?!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You came all the way out here, so why not give a toast and introduce yourself?”[%p]
Maho stood up with a slight frown, and thought for a moment before she opened her mouth.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thank you all for having me today.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Dr. Leskinen and I are from America, so we’ve never spent Christmas in Japan before.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And I’m finding out that spending a cheerful Christmas with friends is also a great—”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Say something interesting, nya!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Something interesting, nya!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Wha—?! Um... um...”[%p]
Faris... you’re crazy.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hm... um... uh...”[%p]
Uh-oh. She was totally losing it. She was worse than Mayuri had been a moment ago.[%p]
It was hard to believe I’d seen her interpreting in front of that huge crowd at ATF.[%p]
Was she bad at ad-libbing?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Uh... Meow!”[%p]
Maho’s desperate attempt at “something interesting” was cute, but honestly a little embarrassing.[%p]
It felt like watching a small, adorable animal.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ooh! Maho-nyan! You’ve got what it takes to be a cat-eared maid!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup! This is the birth of Mahorin Nyan-nyan!”[%p]
Faris and Mayuri were the only ones who seemed really impressed.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Ugh... what am I doing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san, that toast...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“R-Right! I’ll do that. Okay then...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Cheers!”[%p]
[name]Everyone[line]“Cheers!”[%p]
Everybody happily clinked their glasses together.[%p]
Since I was the one who invited Maho to the party, I decided to cheer her up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That was an interesting toast.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I hate myself.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“What are you talking about? You were a cool cat!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Maho-nyan, when are you starting at MayQueen?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m not, okay?”[%p]
Faris and Dr. Leskinen were both enjoying trying to make her feel better.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san, let’s have a toast!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Me too, Suzuha-san!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, yeah.”[%p]
Suzuha still had a somber look on her face, but Mayuri, Yuki, and Daru forced her into a toast.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Here, Suzu-san. Mayushii made this.”[%p]
Mayuri put a piece of quiche on a plate and gave it to Suzuha.[%p]
When Suzuha took a bite, her expression began to shine.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s good!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eat more. Eat a lot!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I c-can’t eat it all at once.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, yeah?”[%p]
Next, Mayuri offered the quiche to Maho and the professor.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maho-san and Leskinen-san, try some too!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thanks...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Mmm... it’s good! This is really good!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Okay, try this too. It’s shrimp gratin and ethnic-style fried chicken.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Excellent!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You really put a lot of effort into this.”[%p]
Yuki went around and offered everyone something to eat.[%p]
But she couldn’t bring herself to offer any to Suzuha.[%p]
Mayuri kept motioning for her to go over, but Yuki just kept fidgeting.[%p]
Maybe she was thinking about it too much.[%p]
But Suzuha kept devouring all the food that Mayuri and Yuki had prepared, and gushing over each dish.[%p]
The two of them had been practicing their cooking for about a month here in the lab.[%p]
I guess it paid off.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, there’s cake, too! Kaede-san did the decorations.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“I didn’t do a very good job, so forgive me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kaede-san’s really kind of clumsy. But doesn’t that just make her cuter?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“That really doesn’t feel like a compliment.”[%p]
Everyone laughed.[%p]
Then, about an hour after we started eating...[%p]
When she saw that everyone had eaten enough food, Faris clapped her hands together loudly to draw everyone’s attention.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Okay, everykitty! Now that we’re all having fun, I’d like to start exchanging presents, nya!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“We didn’t have any time to get something good. I hope that’s okay.”[%p]
Maho and the professor had stopped at a Donkey Xote on their way from Wako City, and spent just ten minutes picking out presents.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Don’t worry. That’s fine, nya.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I didn’t bring anything...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi and I brought yours.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii was the one who chose it!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I see... sorry.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t worry!”[%p]
Mayuri mimicked Daru’s words as she pulled out two small, wrapped parcels from her bag and put them on the table.[%p]
They both had the same wrapping as the one Daru was holding. They must’ve bought them at the same place.[%p]
Mayuri had already explained to me “Operation #2.”[%p]
Mayuri’s plan for the evening was not only to make Suzuha smile, but to bring Yuki and Daru a little closer together.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I thought of a lot of different ways to decide who gets what purr-esents, but in the end I decided we’re just going to draw numbers, nyan.”[%p]
Faris gathered together everyone’s presents, and put little stickers with numbers on them.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyan-nyan-nyan!”[%p]
And then she lifted a bundle of disposable chopsticks up above her head.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Mayushii brought these so we could play the King’s Game tonight, nya!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wah! Don’t say that, Feris-chan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Mayuri... the King’s Game is something you play at singles’ parties...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I know that! I just got a little confused.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, I love it when girls order me to do things.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Hashida-san, you really are a pervert.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So we’re going to use these chopsticks that Mayushii was a little confused about, and use them to pick presents, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Whatever number’s on the chopstick you draw, that’s the present you get, nyan!”[%p]
Faris loudly shuffled all the chopsticks, and then went around to everyone so they could draw one.[%p]
She was also part of Mayuri’s plan.[%p]
In fact, Mayuri and Faris were sending signals to each other with eye contact and with their fingers.[%p]
While everyone was focusing on the chopsticks, they were busy relabeling Yuki and Daru’s presents.[%p]
They were so obvious about it that I started getting nervous that Yuki would find out.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Everybody get a chopstick, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Okay, I’ll hand out the purr-esents. No opening your present ’till everyone’s got theirs!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“This is really exciting, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I wonder what I’m going to get?”[%p]
Faris and Mayuri passed out the presents according to the numbers that everyone drew.[%p]
Once the presents were handed out, everyone started to take off the wrapping paper.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Wha—?!”[%p]
Nae was the first to react as she gave out a very strange cry. Inside her box was a skull face.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, isn’t that cool?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s a belt buckle, Nae-chan. If you wear it to school, I’m sure it’ll make you very popular.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Thank... you...”[%p]
Lukako, you terrified her...[%p]
I was feeling bad for Nae, but when I took out my own present...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh... whose idea was this?”[%p]
The box had a cute design, and inside it was what looked like a see-through white veil. The veil was decorated here and there with little pink ribbons.[%p]
This can’t be a...[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Hmm? Oh, you got it, Okarin-san!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“You can give it to Mayushii as a present.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No way!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“I’m sure she’d be happy to wear it for you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are we talking about this...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What? What? What’s this about me?”[%p]
Mayuri heard her own name and came over.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...? What’s that, I wonder?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“It’s [color index="280AA02D1400"]babydoll[color index="800000"] lingerie, Mayushii. And a super cute and sexy one! You can wear it for Okarin-san, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fweeh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know that’s not happening.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Then why don’t you... wear it yourself?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I-I’m giving this back. You can enjoy it yourself.”[%p]
I pushed the babydoll lingerie back into Fubuki’s hands.[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Okay, want to exchange it for what I got?”[%p]
Fubuki handed me her present in exchange.[%p]
The wrapping and lid had already been removed. I took a quick look inside.[%p]
Sexy pink shorts and a pink bra.[%p]
Yup, they were see-through.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Oh, that was the present I brought.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“I’d love it if you had Mayuri-chan wear it. Enjoy...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fweeh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that all you people think about?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii already got a present from Okarin! So I’m okay.”[%p]
Mayuri had drawn my present. Perhaps because we were childhood friends?[%p]
By the way, I’d chosen a huge chunk of chocolate in the shape of a gold bar. The kind of thing you find in a Donkey Xote bargain bin.[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Okarin-san, was there really nothing else you could’ve gotten?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sh-Shut up. I read in a magazine that these things make hilarious party gifts.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“No, there’s no way anybody would want to get this. None.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Not a chance.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
Not even a chance...?[%p]
The magazine said it was a sure thing![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s happy! It’s a gold bar! I’m never going to get to touch another one in my whole life!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Aw... You’re such a good girl, Mayushii.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“You really are a good girl. There, there.”[%p]
Fubuki and Kaede were patting Mayuri’s head, half out of sympathy, and half because she was cute.[%p]
Somehow... I ended up as the bad guy.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Okay, now it’s my turn to open.”[%p]
Yuki started to open her present.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Wow...”[%p]
She took out a cute wooden music box. When she opened the lid, there was a little tin figure that danced.[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Wow, it’s so cute!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“It’s wonderful...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So romantic!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“That’s so nice.”[%p]
The girls all seemed really impressed.[%p]
But Lukako is a guy.[%p]
It definitely looked like something a woman would enjoy receiving. With as many girls as there were coming to this party, it might have been the perfect choice.[%p]
Wait, maybe I should’ve brought something like that.[%p]
But then I realized that the idea had never even occurred to me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Whose present could this be, nya?”[%p]
Faris... you’re making it too obvious.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, um... me.”[%p]
Daru reluctantly raised his hand.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Wha—?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Oh my...!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Uncle Daru, you’re amazing!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hmm... nice, Brother.”[%p]
Everyone, except Mayuri and Faris, who knew about it in advance, raised their voices in surprise.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“This is from you, then, Hashida-san?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-What do you think? Mayu-shi was the one who told me to get it.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“It’s wonderful... Thank you. I’ll treasure this.”[%p]
Yuki held the music box close to her chest. She seemed really happy.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...?”[%p]
And then her expression turned confused as she looked down into the box.[%p]
Then she started to fidget.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um... excuse me. I need a second.”[%p]
She hurried off toward the washroom, still holding the box.[%p]
She must’ve seen the “trick.”[%p]
According to what Mayuri had told me earlier, there was a (fake) letter from Daru himself taped to the bottom of the box.[%p]
It was something like a love letter, along with an invitation to a movie date.[%p]
I wondered how she was reacting.[%p]
Meanwhile, Daru had also opened his own present, and he looked a little bothered.[%p]
He’d been given Faris’s present.[%p]
Until he’d opened it, he looked really happy, but now he’d gone completely silent.[%p]
According to Mayuri, he was going to get a pair of movie tickets.[%p]
And even though it was a present from Faris, the tickets came with instructions to use them for a date with Yuki.[%p]
Faris responded to Daru’s questioning gaze with a wink. “Good luck, nya,” she seemed to be saying.[%p]
For her part, Faris received some kind of strange doll that Maho had bought at the Donkey Xote.[%p]
Lukako’s present was a miniature remote-controlled helicopter that Dr. Leskinen had purchased.[%p]
And Dr. Leskinen got a set of 12 cute little crayons from Nae.[%p]
Suzuha’s present was a pair of handmade gloves. Yuki had evidently made them herself.[%p]
She put them on, looking happy—but maybe a little lonely—and smiled.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s great, Suzuha.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait, what did you get, Brother?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
Daru realized he’d been set up, and he was clearly avoiding looking at her.[%p]
Suzuha seemed to understand, and patted him on the back with a gentle expression on her face.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What’s wrong with that? Go have a good time.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wh—? What? Et tu, Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, it’s frustrating watching you two.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But... I’ve never been on a real date.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Neither has Mom, supposedly.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? Really?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I-I see...”[%p]
Yuki came back from the bathroom.[%p]
She seemed to be having trouble walking straight.[%p]
She sat back in her seat, but began to nervously nibble on snacks at the table.[%p]
And once in a while, she would take a look at Daru.[%p]
For now, the movie ticket plan seemed to be going well.[%p]
Staring too much could tip her off. I should probably pretend I didn’t know anything.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ooh, Maho-san got the music box Mayushii brought.”[%p]
Mayuri raised her voice when she saw the music box in Maho’s hands.[%p]
It was shaped like a deformed bear, and when you wound it up its hands and legs would jerk back and forth as it played a tune.[%p]
It was a very different design than the one Yuki had received.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Is it really okay for me to get something as nice as this?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sure it is! Go ahead, go ahead!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“What kind of music does it play? I want to hear!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yeah, me too.”[%p]
Maho started to wind it up.[%p]
As she wound it, Kaede turned off the music in the background.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Here we go...”[%p]
Maho took her hand off the winding key, and the mechanical, yet gentle sound that was unique to music boxes began to play.[%p]
The lively atmosphere of the lab was replaced with a feeling of calmness and peace.[%p]
We listened quietly to the sound of the music box.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii really likes this song.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So do I.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“It makes you feel all warm, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, it does.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, I see... this is the song.”[%p]
Suzuha stood up, as if she suddenly remembered something.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yuki-san, don’t you remember?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? What?”[%p]
Yuki was spacing out so hard that she started to panic when Suzuha spoke to her.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When I was sick, you sang this song for me here.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Oh, come to think of it...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah, it’s definitely this song.”[%p]
Suzuha seemed to be remembering something as her eyes narrowed.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey, Big Sis Mayu, what song is this?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, this is...”[%p]
Mayuri was about to speak—and then...[%p]
Out of nowhere...[%p]
The world twisted.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
I moaned in pain as an incredible sense of “wrongness” flooded through me.[%p]
The whole lab seemed to twist and fade...[%p]
And the happy party I’d been experiencing warped and waved like a mirage.[%p]
Th-This... it couldn’t be... no...[%p]
Somewhere far away, I heard something that sounded like a violent crash.[%p]
I was just barely able to move my eyes in the direction it came from, and I saw Fubuki falling to the floor as she knocked over a table.[%p]
Kaede and Faris ran over to her, calling her name.[%p]
But it all looked so blurred, like I was watching a movie underwater, and everything was moving so slow.[%p]
Their voices were getting further and further away.[%p]
No matter how much I stretched out my hand, it reached no one and touched nothing.[%p]
It was a terrible feeling, as if time and space were being torn apart, and even matter itself was losing its subjectivity.[%p]
Th-This feeling...[%p]
Even if I didn’t want to remember it, I knew what this awful feeling was.[%p]
I knew it far better than I had ever wanted.[%p]
This was—[%p]
Reading... Steiner...![%p]
