[name]Maho[line]Amadeus e Salieri...[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]Kurisu e me.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]These two pairings held a special meaning for me.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart...[%p]
[name]Maho[line]A famous musician, known and loved worldwide.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]His name at baptism was Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]Theophilus is a Greek word meaning “beloved of God.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]Mozart liked it, and chose Amadeus, a Latin word meaning the same thing, as his nickname.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]At the end of his tragically short 35-year life, he left us over 600 masterpieces.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]Was Amadeus truly a special person, beloved and granted special, unique gifts by God?[%e]
[name]Maho[line]I didn’t think so.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]He was a genius, sure. But I think Amadeus had his own struggles and suffering to overcome.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]No matter how wonderful a diamond in the rough might be, it’s worth nothing unless you polish it.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]Writing off his success as the result of his “gifts” is an insult to the effort and struggle he put into his work.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]But at the same time, if you want to be Mozart, don’t you need the same level of raw talent he had?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]There are a lot of people in this world with that kind of talent.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]Makise Kurisu...[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]To me, that was her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]You could feel her talent just by looking at her.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]Her constant stream of new ideas was always a source of inspiration to me.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]I was proud to be able to work with her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]But...[%p]
[name]Maho[line]I didn’t know what I meant to her.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]It was embarrassing to ask. I always hoped I’d get the chance to bring up the subject some day.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]But then on July 28th, 2010...[%e]
[name]Maho[line]Makise Kurisu passed away.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]And I lost the chance to find out what I meant to her forever.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart...[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]During his life, there was a man very close to him who considered him his greatest rival.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]His name was Antonio Salieri.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]I took my account name on the Viktor Chondria university network, “Salieri,” from him.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]The network got a big update a few weeks after Kurisu died. That’s when I chose it.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]I wanted to match the name of the software that Kurisu and I had been working on before her death, which I still worked on to this day. There was no more meaning to it than that.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]The name of that software was “Amadeus.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]It was Dr. Leskinen who came up with the idea of naming this neural network-based AI after the genius composer.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]At the time, I thought it was a good idea. And I still do today.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]...I still do today.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]Amadeus e Salieri...[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]Kurisu e me.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]These two pairings held a special meaning for me.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]I loved Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]I respected Kurisu.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]I admired Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="38"]Io—[%p]
[name]Maho[line][margin top="76"]I...[%e]
