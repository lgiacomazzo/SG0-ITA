Suzuha hit the “play” button on her smartphone’s video display.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The video was heavily compressed and covered in static, but she recognized the person that appeared.[%e]
It was a face she’d known her whole life, a face that had been with her both in her past and her present.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The man, who she still remembered holding her up in the air as a child, was probably about 35 in the video.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, Suzuha. How you doing? It’s Daddy. And it’s the year 2025.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m really sorry to dump all this on you. Really. Forgive me, please.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If you’re seeing this video message... that means you, no, you and Mayu-shi, have found another path to Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In other words, the plan’s moved to the next phase.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You might be angry and wondering why I didn’t tell you all this from the start.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But it wasn’t that I didn’t want to. It’s that I couldn’t.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In the linea di universo you originally set out from, I never planned the operation that I’m about to describe.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’ve probably already noticed, but the choice you and Mayu-shi just made has changed the linea di universo a little.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In other words, I’m a different Hashida Itaru than the one in your linea di universo.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But Suzuha, please don’t get the wrong idea. No matter what linea di universo I’m in, I love my daughter.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Heheh, by the way, which Daddy is more handsome?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ve started weightlifting lately, heh heh... Hum?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! Stop screwing around and explain the mission.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. We all know you’ll give it up in a week. Stop wasting her time.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We’ll run out of time to record, nya!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Come on, don’t rush me.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So anyway, let me get on to the real reason I’m sending you this message.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I am about to share with you the details of Operation Arc-light.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This is going to take everything you’ve got, and not a single mistake will be allowed. Pay attention and don’t miss a word. Got it?”[%p]
Suzuha paused the video there.[%p]
[margin top="38"]If he was telling her to pay attention, it must be important. If she was going to memorize it all, she needed to calm down.[%e]
Ad essere onesti, getting a video from her dad in 2025 had made her really excited.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It felt like her father was telling her that the plan she’d come up with on her own was the right one.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That’s why she needed to pay careful attention.[%e]
Mayuri was standing by herself, typing something into her phone as fast as she could.[%p]
[margin top="38"]When the video had arrived, she’d told Mayuri that they may have to leave for the past today.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There must have been some reason the video was sent today, at this time.[%p]
That’s how it seemed to Suzuha.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, Suzu-san? How’s it going? Are we going to leave today?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m about to check the mission parameters.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I see...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... so... if we do leave today, Mayushii’s gonna go missing, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t want to worry anybody, so I want to write a message to Mom and Dad, and to all my friends.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I hope you’ve got time to at least tell Uncle Okarin in person.”[%p]
She would be done going over the mission and deciding on a course of action by sunset, probably.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wrote a message to Okarin, too, so it’s ok.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Just a message?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
Mayuri smiled and nodded.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There were no more tears in her eyes, but you could still see wet lines drawn down her soft, pink cheeks.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...It’s kind of... embarrassing.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, I wrote this message, and then I realized maybe I can’t send it. So now I’m not sure what to do.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t get a signal. Maybe this is a dead zone?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You can’t get signal?”[%p]
Suzuha looked at the screen on Mayuri’s phone.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There wasn’t a single bar on the antenna.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s strange. You can always get a signal up here.”[%p]
Suzuha took out her own phone to double-check.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Mine, too.”[%p]
When she saw that Mayuri was using a different cell carrier than her, she frowned.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”[%p]
She told Mayuri to hide behind the time machine, and silently moved up against the iron door leading to the stairs.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She opened it a crack, taking care not to let it creak.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
She looked inside the building. It was as quiet as ever.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There was nothing on the floor below but a room for events and some storerooms, so on weekdays like this it was always quiet.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](...Is it my imagination?)[%p]
She tilted her head sideways as she softly tried to close the door.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kyahh!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“?!”[%p]
At Mayuri’s scream she turned around, just in time to see armed agents in camouflage jumping over the fence.[%p]
[margin top="38"]One of them had grabbed Mayuri.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](They climbed up the walls?!)[%p]
Suzuha deeply regretted her mistake.[%p]
She was well aware that someone could try to come up the walls.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But the video from her dad had made her so excited, she’d lowered her guard.[%e]
There were about thirty men, all carrying small assault rifles.[%p]
With Mayuri as their hostage, Suzuha couldn’t do anything.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Drop your gun and get on the ground. Hands on top of your head.”[%p]
One of the men gave her an order in a cold voice.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Resist, and we can’t guarantee this girl’s safety.”[%p]
He pulled Mayuri close and put the gun to her head, then flipped off the safety.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Damn it...”[%p]
She had no choice but to obey. Suzuha took the gun out of her holster and put it on the ground, then took a pose where she couldn’t resist.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t talk. They’ll kill you if they have to.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m just fine.”[%p]
From the way they moved, she could easily tell they were veteran professionals.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That meant they were certainly after the time machine, and probably well aware that only Suzuha could operate it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That, Suzuha decided, meant they wouldn’t kill her if they didn’t have to.[%e]
The man who’d spoken to her first, who was probably the leader, knelt down next to her. She was searched, roughly, to make sure she wasn’t carrying any other weapons.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Grr... I’m a girl, you know. Show some respect.”[%p]
They took the other small pistol she carried for emergencies, as well as several different kinds of knives.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Target 2 and Target 3 have been secured.”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“What about you?”[%p]
The leader spoke to the group of men gathering around the time machine.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Target 1 secured. It’s locked, and anything we try is met with an error.”[%p]
Several of the men had gone inside the machine as well.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Leaving the hatch open had been Suzuha’s own mistake, but still, it upset her to see them inside the machine.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s no use. It won’t listen to anyone but me.”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“...Stand up.”[%p]
The leader kicked her with the heel of his boot.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Keep your hands where they are. Move slowly. Try anything and we’ll kill the hostage immediately.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
When she stood up, her hands were handcuffed behind her back.[%p]
They prodded her from behind to move next to the machine.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“...Riconoscimento biometrico, non è vero?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But you can’t copy my veins or fingerprints.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Cutting off my hand or ripping out my eyeball won’t work, either.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Security systems in the year 2036 aren’t that easily fooled.”[%p]
The men in camo seemed aware of everything she said.[%p]
None of them seemed surprised or irritated.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Where’s the professor?”[%p]
The leader asked the man who was pointing the gun at Mayuri.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“He’s on his way.”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“...Target 1 is only useful if Target 2 is with it. Tell him it’s impossible without lavaggio del cervello.”[%p]
Suzuha gritted her teeth when she heard the word “lavaggio del cervello.”[%p]
[margin top="38"]She had seen many of her friends in Valchirie undergo this cruel procedure, then be sent back as spies before turning into vegetables.[%e]
The leader turned toward Suzuha.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“You know what happens when you’re brainwashed, I believe. The professor doesn’t use drugs. He alters your brain directly.”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“I think it would be smarter just to help us. What do you think?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The professor...?”[%p]
Where she’d come from, an old doctor with that name had lead a lavaggio del cervello team that had attempted to destroy Valchirie. Suzuha had hated him more than anyone else.[%p]
[margin top="38"]They hadn’t used drugs, either.[%p]
It was safe to assume that both “professors” were the same person.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Fine.”[%p]
She nodded.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll help you. But I can’t do it like this.”[%p]
Suzuha jangled the cuffs behind her back.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“We’ll take off the handcuffs. But if you resist, the girl dies.”[%p]
There was still a gun pointed at Mayuri’s head.[%p]
Even if she tried to resist, it would be impossible to save Mayuri from this many professional soldiers.[%e]
When she went inside the cockpit, she used her dati biometrici to bypass the lock and brought up the control console.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Lights came on all across the machine, and she could hear a low rumbling.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Ok. Get out. We’ll investigate the rest.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I don’t think you’re going to be able to understand it, but sure.”[%p]
As Suzuha left the cockpit, the leader turned his gaze toward a particular cluster of the men, which seemed to be engineers.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—That was the moment she was waiting for.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Her hand had wandered below the console for just a moment when she left the cockpit.[%p]
She’d hidden some knives there.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Without making a sound,[%p]
she threw it at the leader.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Gah!”[%p]
The knife pierced his throat. He went down so quickly, he hadn’t even even had time to scream.[%e]
She quickly readied another knife and darted between the men in camo.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Her target was the man pointing a gun at Mayuri’s head.[%e]
She dropped her hips low to the ground. In an instant, she moved behind him and slit his throat.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Blood poured out onto an astonished Mayuri, but there was no time to worry about her.[%e]
She grabbed his rifle and fired a few shots to force them to the ground, then grabbed Mayuri’s hand and ran behind the machine.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Tch!”[%p]
The plan had gone well so far, but she had seriously underestimated how well-trained these men were.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The second-in-command quickly moved to the front and worked to reestablish control.[%p]
[margin top="38"]All she had was a knife and the gun she’d stolen.[%p]
And she needed to protect Mayuri, a non-combatant.[%e]
She was still facing more than twenty-five active enemies.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Whatever the right way to get out of this was, she couldn’t find it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The time machine was still active. She couldn’t escape because she couldn’t leave it here.[%e]
One of the men fired several rounds toward her, which bounced off the side of the machine.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aah—”[%p]
And then Mayuri’s head flew back, as if she’d been struck.[%p]
A spurt of blood came out.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Big Sis Mayu!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aaah... aah...”[%p]
Her cute face was turning blood red.[%p]
[margin top="38"]One of the rounds had grazed her after it had ricocheted. [%e]
She was clutching herself with her arms, and her expression was completely blank.[%p]
Her tiny body was shaking.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha couldn’t blame her.[%e]
She fired back at the enemy, but they kept drawing closer.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](I’ve been through a lot of fights... but I don’t think I’ve ever seen things get this bad.)[%p]
The time machine’s maintenance hatch was right in front of her.[%p]
When she saw that it was there, she visualized her last option in her mind.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](If I open that... I can blow the machine up from within.)[%p]
If she did that, all of her plans would be ruined.[%p]
The path to Steins Gate would be forever closed.[%e]
But that didn’t mean she was cold-blooded enough to sacrifice Mayuri here.[%p]
[margin top="38"]If the le linee di universo were going to converge, maybe Mayuri wouldn’t die here at all.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But what her father had said during his video message bothered her.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’ve probably already noticed, but the choice you and Mayu-shi just made has changed the linea di universo a little.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In other words, I’m a different Hashida Itaru than the one in your linea di universo.”[%p]
Which meant that Suzuha had no proof that Mayuri would be alive in 2036 now.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—Had the linea di universo really changed?[%e]
Of course, for the sake of Operation Arc-light, she hoped it had.[%p]
But that meant she wouldn’t be able to move from this place.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](—Imagine the worst-case scenario.)[%p]
The worst-case scenario. That would be these men taking the time machine.[%p]
[margin top="38"]They could turn the linea di universo into something even worse than the one Suzuha had experienced.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It might become a linea di universo where not only Mayuri’s life wasn’t safe, but Daru’s wasn’t either.[%e]
If that was going to happen—[%p]
[margin top="38"]She had to make her choice fast.[%e]
She kept a careful eye on the men, and as soon as she saw an opening, she opened the maintenance hatch’s biometric lock.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She could see part of the engine, which was still giving off a quiet rumble. She turned her gun sights on it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Fortunately, the unit that created the buco nero di Kerr still wasn’t active. Even if she blew up the machine here, it probably wouldn’t cause serious damage to the space-time continuum.[%e]
As soon as she saw that, she went to pull the trigger—[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“N-No...”[%p]
Mayuri’s forceful voice stopped her dead in her tracks.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t destroy it...!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t stop me! I’ve already made my decision!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Just as Mayuri had stopped her before...[%p]
Once again her forceful voice caused Suzuha to hesitate, if only for an instant.[%p]
[margin top="38"]On the battlefield, that instant can decide your fate.[%e]
She took a quick look around again.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And then she froze.[%e]
Mixed in with the men in camo was a girl in a dark motorcycle suit and helmet.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](H-Her?! Kagari..?!)[%p]
Was it Kagari who had leaked this place’s location to them?[%e]
She was well aware of Kagari’s abilities after their two battles.[%p]
If she wasn’t completely in control of herself, she’d be killed instantly.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She talked to herself.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](I’ll have to give up on my own survival...)[%p]
How many would she have to take with her in order to give Mayuri a chance to escape?[%p]
Right now, the only thing she could afford to think about was getting Mayuri back to Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But just when she’d made her decision—[%e]
She felt Kagari staring at her, or more precisely, the blood dripping down Mayuri’s forehead.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And just after that,[%p]
Kagari did something she hadn’t expected at all.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...What did you do to Mamma...?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“WHAT DID YOU DO TO MAMMA?!”[%p]
There was a scream.[%p]
[margin top="38"]No, it was the howl of an enraged beast.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?!”[%p]
And then the slaughter began.[%e]
Kagari grabbed the second-in-command’s head with her left hand. With her right, she steadied her rifle. After she fired, there was very little left of his head.[%e]
The rest of him dropped to the ground.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“...Hyah?!”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“What?! What are you doing?”[%p]
She slammed the piece of tattered flesh that had once been a man’s head into the ground, and with no warning at all leaped from one screaming man to another.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She fired her gun into every one of them.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“What did you do to Mamma?! What did you to do to Mamma?! What did you do?!”[%p]
Even when her targets were already soaked in a sea of blood, she kept firing until their limbs were blown apart into unrecognizable rags.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Some of them tried shooting her to protect themselves, but no matter where she was struck, Kagari didn’t even flinch.[%e]
When her magazine ran dry, she drew forth long military-style cleavers. Holding one in each hand, she used them and her military combat training to slaughter anyone she saw.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Their entrails were scattered all over the twilight rooftop, covering her whole body in blood and bits of flesh.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t look! Cover your ears, too!”[%p]
Suzuha held Mayuri’s head tight to her chest.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Mayuri was shaking from fear, but she did as she was told and clamped her hands down over her ears.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Even so, she could probably still hear the sounds of ripping flesh and shattering bone.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](She’s not even human anymore...)[%p]
Even Suzuha had gone stone-cold in shock.[%p]
[margin top="38"]During all her time in combat, she’d never seen a one-sided slaughter like this.[%e]
She’d experienced this when they fought, but Kagari seemed to feel no fear or pain. She simply focused all her energy on killing her opponent.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was often said that humans unconsciously avoided using all their muscle power to protect their own bodies.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But Kagari seemed to lack that capability.[%e]
Just now she’d stabbed a man who’d turned to run from her in the back, then tossed his huge body to the ground with only a single arm. Then she kicked his stomach from below and ruptured his organs, killing him.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“S-S-Surround her and fire! It’s just one girl!”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Get around to the right! The right!”[%p]
Finally after several—perhaps a dozen or more—of the men had been killed, what remained of the squad started to scream orders at one another.[%e]
With terrifying reflexes, she dodged between their shots and brutally murdered several more.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But—[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Gahh...!”[%p]
At last, a hail of gunfire struck her left hand, and the knife she was holding fell to the floor.[%p]
[margin top="38"]No, that wasn’t it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It wasn’t the knife that fell, it was her entire left hand.[%e]
The shock caused her body to stagger back.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“N-Now! Fire!”[%p]
Someone screamed, in a voice that lacked any of the pride and bravery a soldier is supposed to possess.[%e]
Several more bullets dug into her body.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Parts of the motorcycle suit ripped open, and the helmet cracked. Blood that was clearly her own, not that of the men she’d killed, began to pour out.[%e]
At last, she fell into a pile of corpses.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“Ok!”[%p]
They must’ve thought they finally had her.[%p]
One of the survivors pointed his gun down to finish her, and just as he was about to pull the trigger—[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ghgaahhh!”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Uwaaahh!”[%p]
Her bestial roar and the man’s terrified scream overlapped in a horrible cacophony. [%e]
She forced herself to leap up and brought the back of the remaining cleaver down on his arm, knocking him back.[%p]
[margin top="38"]An instant later, the knife slit his throat and ended his life.[%e]
[name]Armed man[line]“R-Retreat! Retreat!”[%p]
The survivors began to flee in terror.[%e]
