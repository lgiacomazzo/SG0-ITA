[name]Mayuri[line]“So, once again, Happy New Year’s!”[%p]
[name]Tutti[line]“Buon anno!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“This food your mom made is really good, Luka-kun.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Really? Kagari-san and I helped, too. I’m glad you like it.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yup! Well, I really just did the arranging.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I like this sweet tamagoyaki. It’s all rolled up.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And this ozouni is just delicious! Suzuha, what do you think?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yup. It’s good.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s actually from the Mew Year’s menu at MayQueen+Nyan².”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mmm! It’s so sticky and delicious. It tastes like Faris-tan!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Hashida-san, sei davvero un pervertito, non è vero?”[%p]
Fubuki was barely putting any effort into her comments to Daru anymore.[%p]
A whole day of his perversion must have tired her out.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If we were in America, you could sue him for sexual harassment.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Say, what do they eat for New Year’s in America?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know. Turkey, maybe?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Isn’t that Christmas?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Americans like to party on New Year’s Eve, so they don’t eat much on New Year’s. Beans, maybe?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I sure do love licking a girl’s beans!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Hashida-san, sei davvero un pervertito, non è vero?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Here, Nae-nyan! These glazed chestnuts are really good, nya.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And these black beans look like they’re very nutritious.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Um... uh... I can’t eat all that.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You can take your time. Chew thoroughly, ok?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Heheh! You’re like a mom, Kagari-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Isn’t it fun having so many people around, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sì, hai ragione.”[%p]
How long had it been since we’d all had this much fun at the lab?[%p]
No, that was in the linea di universo Alfa.[%p]
Which means that this may have been the first time in the linea di universo Beta that we’d done something like this.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Unya? Is this the only tea we’ve got, nya?”[%p]
The party hadn’t started that long ago, but evidently we were already out of tea.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“My brother only bought sweet drinks.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If they have no tea, then let them drink soda!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t know if I want to drink soda on New Year’s...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right, Daru and I will go buy some.”[%p]
I couldn’t let the girls go.[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Oh, Fubuki-chan and I will go.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Me, too?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“They were nice enough to invite us. It’s the least we could do.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“I guess so. Ok, bye. I can just get whatever, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. Thanks, it’s a big help.”[%p]
There was a very brief silence after Kaede and Fubuki left.[%p]
But then someone’s phone rang.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sorry, it’s mine.”[%p]
She took out her phone and checked the screen, then looked at me.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hey, Okabe-san. Can I access Amadeus right now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The call’s from her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And it would make for really good data if I could see how she reacts to a situation like this. Can I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Beh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Maho-san! Maho-san! What’s Amadeus?”[%p]
The next thing I knew, the call from [Kurisu] had stopped, and instead everyone was listening to us.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s an intelligenza artificiale that incorporates a specific individual’s memory data.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A-Artificial...?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“An AI, nya.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“AI...?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“AI stands for Ancient Intelligence. In other words, the great, lost wisdom of ages past, nya!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It stands for Intelligenza Artificiale.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s a program that thinks and learns on its own.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But if it incorporates a specific person’s memories, doesn’t that mean it’s a copy of them?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What we’re trying to find out right now is whether it’s a copy or not.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And that’s Amadeus? Wow, I had no idea you were making something like that.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-kun, do you know what he’s talking about?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No, I’m afraid I don’t.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It would be easier just to show you, but...”[%p]
She glanced over at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As long as you don’t point the camera toward me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“All right.”[%p]
She sighed and reached toward the icon on the smartphone with her finger.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? You can run it on a phone?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s actually running on a university server. We just made it so you can use this as an access point.”[%p]
Daru was staring down at the screen with stars in his eyes.[%p]
And as soon I heard the voice from her phone—[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Come on, Senpai! Why won’t you pick up—”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Wah!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, wow!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What? You’re not Senpai... Who are you?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Me? I’m Hashida Itaru. Feel free to call me Itaru if you want. Preferably with your eyes turned upward and your cheeks slightly reddened.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“W-Why would I call you by name when I don’t even know you? Who are you, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sorry to scare you.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Oh, Senpai... Who is this?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“His name’s Hashida-san. He’s a friend of Okabe-san’s. It’s New Year’s today, right? So I’m at his lab having a party with his friends.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Right, Okabe-san. That cold, uncaring man?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You should probably avoid hanging out with him too much. Otherwise, he might abandon you some day.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Now, now...”[%p]
There was ice in her words... She must’ve been really mad.[%p]
Well, I guess I could understand why.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So anyway, I’ll introduce you all. This is Amadeus, an AI with the personality and memories of Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What? Makise Kurisu—?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You mean THE Makise Kurisu?!”[%p]
The Hashida family’s voices rose in unison.[%p]
That’s right. Those two knew about Kurisu.[%p]
And they knew what happened to her.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Wasn’t Makise Kurisu-san murdered at Radi-Kan in July...?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Makise... Kurisu-san... So this is her...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Oh, so you all know the original me, do you?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, well... Yeah, I suppose.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Don’t let it bother you. I know what happened to my original.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“O-Oh, you do?”[%p]
That was easier said than done.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Hey, is this a video game?”[%p]
Nae seemed to be the only one who didn’t get what was going on.[%p]
But for now, I was glad of that.[%p]
Her words broke the tension that was building up in the room.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Heheh. I’m not a video game. I’m an AI. I talk and think on my own, just like you do.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Wait, is this really an AI, nya? That’s amazing, nya!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Maho-senpai’s the one who’s amazing. She made me.”[%p]
Everyone was staring in awe at [Kurisu] as she answered their questions.[%p]
I started to regret this.[%p]
I shouldn’t have let [Kurisu] talk here.[%p]
I shouldn’t have made them all remember [Kurisu].[%p]
I needed to end this conversation as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-sa—”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
The second I spoke, Maho emitted a small cry of surprise.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Che cosa è successo?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Amadeus just disappeared.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe the app crashed? That happens sometimes.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, but... I tried restarting and it couldn’t connect to the servers.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe they’re doing a server update?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If so, nobody told me about it.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It looks like I can still get a data connyanction here.”[%p]
Faris had tried and succeeded to connect her own smartphone to the web.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s strange. This has never happened before.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hey, Okabe-san. Can you try it on your phone?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, io...”[%p]
I don’t think [Kurisu] likes me—but before I could end my sentence, I heard a crash.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I-I’m sorry.”[%p]
Kagari had evidently dropped a glass.[%p]
Little fragments were spread out all over the floor.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Are you ok? You look pale.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah... thanks. I’m just a little tired, maybe.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, but I’m fine. Sorry. I’ll clean it up right away.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You just stay put, Kagari-san. I’ll clean it up.”[%p]
It was in the instant that Luka stood up to get the broom that I heard the sound.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Nobody move!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
Armed men stormed into the room out of nowhere. Nobody knew what was going on.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“W-W-W-What, nya?!”[%p]
They were all wearing strange masks.[%p]
They were all holding guns.[%p]
Some of them had assault rifles.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“W-What is this? Some kind of surprise?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah... aaaah...”[%p]
The sight brought that nightmare back to me.[%p]
Mayuri’s brutal murder, which I’d seen again and again and again and again...[%p]
I thought I was ok now.[%p]
I thought everything was over.[%p]
Was this because of the linea di universo change two weeks ago?![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aaahh... aaaaaaahhh...”[%p]
Mayuri...[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Quiet!”[%p]
Mayuri’s going to die again...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... I’m scared...”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“I said stay quiet!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kyah!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri!”[%p]
A bang.[%p]
A black hole in the floor.[%p]
It’s ok. That was just a warning shot.[%p]
But it was enough to snap everyone out of their terror.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I-Is that real?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san, io... io...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Hyah... uwaah!”[%p]
No! Don’t do anything to tick them off![%p]
They were serious.[%p]
They’d kill anyone they didn’t need without mercy.[%p]
Suzuha![%p]
What was Suzuha doing?![%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Tch...”[%p]
It was no good.[%p]
Nae was clinging to her legs and keeping her from moving.[%p]
No, maybe there were just too many of them for her to do anything about.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tch...”[%p]
I... I had to do something, but my legs were shaking too much for me to manage anything helpful.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“J-Just stay calm, everyone.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s not that easy, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just calm down and do what they want!”[%p]
I’d gone through this more times than I could count, but it was still all I could do to speak.[%p]
But evidently my desperation had gotten through to them, because they stopped panicking, clumped together, and simply waited for the intruders’ next move.[%p]
I heard the sound of heels from behind the armed men.[%p]
A woman’s footsteps, coming up the stairs.[%p]
Was it her?[%p]
Kiryu Moeka—is it you?[%p]
Are you going to kill Mayuri again?[%p]
But what appeared from beyond the door was—[%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“...”[%p]
A woman in black.[%p]
She wore a skin-tight motorcycle suit, and a black helmet.[%p]
The black visor was pulled down, and I couldn’t see her face.[%p]
It had to be her, though—[%p]
But if it was, what did they want?[%p]
Last time, it was me, Daru, and Kurisu.[%p]
But Kurisu was gone.[%p]
Did that mean—they were after Maho?[%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“...”[%p]
The woman silently looked around the room, and then walked over to us and reached out her hand.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh?”[%p]
She grabbed Kagari’s arm and yanked her forward.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“K-Kagari-san!”[%p]
They were after Kagari?![%p]
But why her?[%p]
No, there was only one reason they’d want her.[%p]
Did they know, then?[%p]
That Kagari was from the year 2036.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“N-No! Let me go!”[%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“—!”[%p]
Kagari struggled.[%p]
But that woman was stronger than she’d imagined, and she was easily pulled away.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No! Save me! Somebody!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mayuri-chan! Help me!”[%p]
Mayuri and Kagari reached out their hands.[%p]
But they both grabbed nothing but air.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Cosa devo fare?[%p]
Cosa dovrei fare?[%p]
If I moved, Mayuri would—everyone would—[%p]
Then did I have to just watch as she was taken away?[%p]
Io...[%p]
Io...[%p]
[name]Uomo armato[line]“Gwah!”[%p]
There was suddenly a scream from near the door.[%p]
[name]Uomo armato[line]“Gah!”[%p]
By the time I looked over, the second man was already falling to the floor.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey! What the hell’s going on here?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Braun-shi!”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Damn it!”[%p]
Before he could turn his gun around, Tennouji had grabbed his hand and twisted it upward.[%p]
I heard the dull sound of snapping bone.[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Gyah!”[%p]
The men seemed unsure of how to handle this sudden intruder.[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“Grr—!”[%p]
One of the men decided to run toward us.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Huh?”[%p]
He reached for what looked like the weakest member of our group.[%p]
Normally, this would’ve been the right choice. But this time, it was the worst choice he could’ve made.[%p]
With speed that you would never imagine from someone so huge, Tennouji closed the gap between himself and that man in an instant, slamming him into the wall.[%p]
When they saw him bounce off and hit the floor, the others became deathly pale.[%p]
And then Suzuha, whose legs were now free of Nae’s grasp, moved as well.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hahh!!”[%p]
A thin, muscular leg—the exact opposite of what you’d expect to see from Daru’s daughter—lashed upward, straight for the motorcycle suit woman’s neck.[%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“—!”[%p]
The woman blocked the kick with her arm at the last moment.[%p]
But when she moved her hand to block, she let go of Kagari.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari!”[%p]
I reached out my hand and quickly pulled her close.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Donna in completo da motociclista[line]“—!”[%p]
Realizing the tide had turned, the woman leaped out of the lab in an instant, clutching her injured arm.[%p]
The other attackers followed suit, carrying their injured fellows.[%p]
In a moment, the chaos was replaced with silence.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O-Okarin...”[%p]
Mayuri’s quavering voice brought me back to reality.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, are you ok?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Y-Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about the rest of you? You ok? You’re not hurt?”[%p]
Daru, Suzuha, Faris, Lukako, Nae, Maho, Kagari—[%p]
Their faces were drained of color, but none of them seemed hurt.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“D-DADDY!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It’s ok. It’s ok now. Daddy will keep you safe, Nae.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Waah!”[%p]
When they saw the Tennouji family clinging to each other, everyone finally sighed with relief.[%p]
Tuttavia—[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, Okabe. Tell me what the hell’s going on. Who were those people?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... I don’t know.”[%p]
I didn’t.[%p]
At first, I thought they were with SERN.[%p]
But if they were, there was no reason for Tennouji to be here.[%p]
Tennouji Yuugo was actually FB, the leader of the Akihabara Rounders.[%p]
Of course, it was possible that someone working for FB—Moeka, for example—had acted without his knowledge...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
Everyone tensed as the door opened again.[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“We’re back! I brought us a lot of drinks!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Sorry we’re late. Fubuki-chan kept adding more stuff to the cart.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Huh? What happened, guys? You all look so scared.”[%p]
