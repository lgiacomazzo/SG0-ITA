[name]Suzuha[line]“Is Kagari in bad shape?”[%p]
That was the first thing Suzuha said to me when I walked through the door.[%p]
She and Maho were sitting on the sofa.[%p]
I’d told them about the situation already via RINE.[%p]
But they were still worried anyway, probably.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’s calmed down now, but she was very confused for a while.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Is it Kurisu’s memories?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. At this point I don’t think there’s any doubt.”[%p]
I still didn’t know why, but inside Kagari’s mind were Makise Kurisu’s memories.[%p]
The question was how to deal with this problem.[%p]
There were limits to what we could do on our own.[%p]
The most we could hope to do was figure out how this had happened.[%p]
That wouldn’t be a real solution.[%p]
To really fix this, we needed to get her back to normal—to erase Kurisu’s memories and restore the original Kagari.[%p]
And for that we needed the help of a specialist.[%p]
Hiyajo Maho was a specialist in that sense.[%p]
There was nobody else who knew as much about memories and the workings of the brain.[%p]
But there was a problem.[%p]
We still hadn’t told her that Kagari was from the future.[%p]
In this worldline, Maho didn’t know Suzuha and the others that well. Of course, she didn’t know about the future or the time machine.[%p]
Was it okay to tell her?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hey, how did you guys meet Kagari-san?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I wonder what she was up to before she came to Urushibara-san’s house.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kagari was found near the prefectural border in Chiba.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When she woke up, she didn’t have any memories of what had happened before.”[%p]
That was the same as the last worldline.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But she had her memories of when she was a kid, right? You knew her, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Where was she when she was a kid?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha looked at me silently.[%p]
She felt responsible for what Kagari was going through right now, probably.[%p]
I could see on her face that she wanted to bring back the old Kagari, somehow.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, what do we do? Can we tell her?”[%p]
Maho was a scientist.[%p]
If we told her the truth, she’d be sure to take an interest in time travel.[%p]
She might start working on a time machine.[%p]
This was a big risk.[%p]
But—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If we want to save Kagari, we don’t have a choice, I guess.”[%p]
I thought for a moment, then nodded.[%p]
My priority right now was helping Kagari.[%p]
Suzuha nodded back and then turned to face Maho.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Only a very few people know what I’m about to tell you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So make sure you don’t tell anyone, okay?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“W-What’s all this about?”[%p]
Maho seemed overwhelmed by the sudden chill emanating from Suzuha.[%p]
But Suzuha kept talking.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It may seem like a joke, but it isn’t.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Can you promise or not? Pick one.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho looked at me, hesitant.[%p]
But she must have seen something in my face.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“F-Fine. I won’t tell anyone. I promise.”[%p]
She nodded.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“All right, I’ll start by answering your first question. Where were Kagari and I when she was a kid...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We were living in 2036, after the Third World War ended and civil wars raged on everywhere.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho’s mouth hung open for a second, but soon her cheeks flushed with anger.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t make fun of me. I’m being serious here.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha remained silent.[%p]
Her eyes were ice-cold, and staring straight into Maho’s.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san, Suzuha warned you at the start. This isn’t a fictional story, and it isn’t a joke.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha and Kagari came from 25 years in the future in a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In a time machine? There’s no way you could make—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if I told you it was Makise Kurisu who came up with the basic theory?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
The second I said Kurisu’s name, the anger vanished from her face.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That... can’t...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Fine. I’ll listen to what you have to say.”[%p]
Suzuha and I told her almost everything.[%p]
How I met Kurisu.[%p]
About the D-Mails.[%p]
What happened in the Alpha worldline.[%p]
The development of the time machine.[%p]
Mayuri’s death.[%p]
La teoria dei campi attrattori.[%p]
What happened in 2036.[%p]
What was going on with Kagari.[%p]
The one thing I didn’t tell her—was the truth about Kurisu’s death.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Just give me a moment to process all that.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What you’re telling me is that Suzuha-san and Kagari-san came here from the year 2036 to have Okabe change the future, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
Maho sank into the sofa and sighed.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t imagine Okabe-san being capable of pulling something like that off.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t believe the fate of all humanity rests on a single person...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t think I can do it, either.”[%p]
I’d given up, actually.[%p]
On the entire future.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s not really believable... but...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But the theory you described might allow for a time leap, yes.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And more than anything, it was Kurisu who came up with that theory, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Then it’s worth looking into.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Because... she was a genius.”[%p]
Her words together seemed like a mixture of admiration, jealousy, and envy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you believe it, yeah?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In exchange, I want you to let me see that time machine.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If you came here in it, it still has to be around, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...It is. It’s very close.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’ll need to look into this, but I’ve decided to believe you for now. So I want you to help me to believe.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“All right.”[%p]
There was no hesitation in her voice.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Thank you.”[%p]
If Suzuha said it was okay, it wasn’t my place to speak.[%p]
If Maho was going to help, that was all that mattered.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s get back to Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like I just told you, she separated from Suzuha when she was ten.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And we have no idea where she was until she was found last month.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m thinking she may not have been in Japan.”[%p]
For how long, I had no way of knowing.[%p]
It may have been the whole time, or perhaps, only a week.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle Okarin’s hypothesis is that she was at Viktor Chondria University.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, and that in some form or another, she made contact with Amadeus.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
The look on Maho’s face was one between acceptance and resignation. She sighed loudly.[%p]
A copy of Kurisu’s memory data had been saved for use by Amadeus.[%p]
This data was the only possible source for the memories within Kagari’s head.[%p]
Her words today had only strengthened my theory.[%p]
Exchange program. Lecture.[%p]
These fragments of memories were all from before she’d come to Japan.[%p]
The memory data had last been saved just before she’d left America.[%p]
That was another match.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I just checked with Dr. Leskinen a while ago. Kurisu’s memory data has been sealed away, and no one can access it, he said.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But I don’t have the authority to check that for myself.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And it’s possible someone took the data before the project was shut down.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The only people who could’ve done that were people involved with the Amadeus research, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Not necessarily. Anyone could do it if they hacked the server.”[%p]
“Anyone” was an exaggeration. Your average person wouldn’t have a clue.[%p]
You’d have to be a super hacker.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The question is why. If your theory’s right, why would they want to do that?”[%p]
The most obvious possibility was that someone wanted access to Makise Kurisu’s mind.[%p]
But Amadeus should suffice for that.[%p]
There was no need to move her memories into another person’s brain.[%p]
And why would they want her mind that badly, anyway?[%p]
She was a genius, sure, but she’d only published a single paper.[%p]
There was no reason to think it would be that important to anyone.[%p]
Unless...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if someone knew that the basic theory of time travel was locked in Kurisu’s memories?”[%p]
Someone out there would want it.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But Kurisu arrived at that theory in the other worldline you were telling me about, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you ever heard of Dr. Nakabachi’s paper?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Nakabachi? The guy who sought asylum in Russia?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I took a look at it, and calling it a ‘paper’ is being way too kind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think it’s an inferior copy. And there’s another version. An original.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Doctor Nakabachi’s real name is Makise Shouichi. He’s Kurisu’s real father.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
I thought back[%p]
to what I saw that day.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve also been thinking about whether it’s possible to create a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Read this. I want your opinion, Dad.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...It’s not bad.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Really?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think maybe we could publish it under both our names...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Don’t publish this. I’ll take it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Come to think of it...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I remember her saying before she left Japan that she was going to see her dad. He was announcing a new theory, and she’d been given an invitation.”[%p]
That day, Nakabachi had stolen Kurisu’s paper.[%p]
And after he’d gone to Russia, he’d published his own paper.[%p]
I hadn’t seen it myself.[%p]
Whenever I thought about it, I always thought about what I’d seen that day, and what happened right after—so I’d been avoiding it.[%p]
But I’d heard the professors at school talking about it.[%p]
It was so terrible that it had become something of a running gag.[%p]
But if it was just a bad copy of an original...[%p]
If what had been published was just Nakabachi’s own reinterpretation of Kurisu’s theory, and her original still existed somewhere else...[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
Kurisu had written the original theory. It had to be better than that.[%p]
She’d actually succeeded in making the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Then you mean someone found out about this paper, and is trying to get the theory needed to make a working time machine out of Kurisu’s brain?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The cause of the Third World War was the intensification of the race for the time machine between the EU and Russia.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Even America started to get involved, and it got completely out of hand.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Things are proceeding exactly as history said they would.”[%p]
Those people had attacked the lab in the last worldline.[%p]
Tennouji had said they weren’t Japanese, but they were military.[%p]
Some military wanted Kurisu’s time machine theory.[%p]
That would explain why they chose to download her memories into Kagari’s mind.[%p]
Amadeus would never talk about something that it didn’t want to talk about.[%p]
But what about a human?[%p]
There were truth serums and torture methods... A human could be forced to talk, maybe.[%p]
Maybe they’d done that to Kagari.[%p]
Of course, this was just a guess.[%p]
But if it was a military that had tried to kidnap Kagari, it was quite possible.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Moving memory data into a brain, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s possible, right? Even with modern technology.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu succeeded in it. And she said it was an application of her own research.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, that’s right. It’s possible.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And that’s what Amadeus was originally created to do.”[%p]
Medical applications, wasn’t it?[%p]
Leskinen had talked about it at the seminar, and Maho had interpreted.[%p]
In this worldline, Amadeus had been shut down and the seminar had never happened, though.[%p]
Maho gave me the same explanation I’d heard before.[%p]
I was right, and memory data transplants were theoretically possible.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kurisu’s Time Leap Machine is another application of this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course, both of them were intended to move the memories back into the original person’s head.”[%p]
And Kurisu had said that even that was dangerous.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Then what would happen if you tried to move them to another person’s head?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t think it would be as simple as copying them to a hard drive on a PC with a different [color index="280AA02D1400"]OS[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“We don’t even know how much capacity the human brain has.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In terms of strict storage capacity, it should easily have enough room to store the memories of two 20 year old girls.”[%p]
Daru had once told me that the brain’s storage capacity was 3.24 terabytes.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But the problem goes beyond that.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Like you said, we’re still not even at the point of successfully downloading memories back into the original brain.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If you tried to copy those memories into someone else’s brain, it could cause serious inconsistency problems.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In fact, we’re seeing those errors start to happen right now.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What will happen to Kagari if we don’t do anything?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Will she turn into Makise Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Memories and personality are different things. Memories are controlled by the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Personality is constructed by the prefrontal cortex.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The functions of the two are intricately connected.”[%p]
Different parts of the brain had different functions, but they weren’t completely independent.[%p]
Memories probably played a large role in forming your personality.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The mix of the two sets of memories is probably putting a lot of stress on her brain.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If we don’t do something, it could cause her entire personality to disintegrate.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Khh...”[%p]
Suzuha slammed her fists into her knees in frustration.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is there some way to stop it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The only way is to remove Kurisu’s memories from Kagari-san’s mind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you do it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If I can analyze the data in her brain, yes, but how many years away that is, I don’t know...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha’s fists were clenched so tightly I could almost hear the sound.[%p]
I could tell she was blaming herself for letting Kagari run away.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If there was a way...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It would be to overwrite her past memories again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Overwrite her memories?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t think whoever altered her memories intended to leave her original ones.”[%p]
She might have been right.[%p]
Putting two sets of memories in one mind was just asking for problems.[%p]
Which means that the experiments they’d done on her had resulted in a different outcome than they’d intended. In a sense, they had failed.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So if we were able to overwrite her memories once more, with proper equipment, it might fix her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But we don’t have that memory data.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“We’ll just have to hope they made backups.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What about the equipment? It would be great if we could just find it somewhere, but...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If it doesn’t exist, we can make it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not that easy...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But Kurisu made it, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Oh, right.[%p]
It had to work similarly to the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Which means I can... No, I will, make it, too.”[%p]
I might be able to help with that.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The question is where to find her memory data, though. We’ll just have to find it somehow.”[%p]
But there simply wasn’t enough information.[%p]
All we knew was that it was a non-Japanese, Western military.[%p]
And that information wasn’t solid, either.[%p]
If anyone held the key, it was the woman in the motorcycle suit...[%p]
I thought of a name and quickly brushed it from my mind.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Any good ideas?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“None.”[%p]
It wasn’t Amane Yuki.[%p]
It couldn’t be...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?”[%p]
We talked late into the night trying to come up with a way to find out who had done the experiments on Kagari.[%p]
But even though we spent a lot of time on it,[%p]
none of us had any good ideas.[%p]
