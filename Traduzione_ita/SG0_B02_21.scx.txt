[name]???[line]“O...san...”[%p]
A voice.[%p]
I could hear a voice.[%p]
[name]???[line]“Okabe-san...”[%p]
Someone was calling my name.[%p]
I slowly woke up and turned toward the voice.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san...”[%p]
Maho was standing in the darkness.[%p]
She had a smile on her face that was somehow lonely, and somehow sad.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re not going to see me again.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If I’m around you, I might betray you again.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Ascolta...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I know this is selfish, but I want you to do something for me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Please... find Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“While you’ve been captured, something terrible has happened to the world...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Mayuri-san and Suzuha-san are both missing.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kagari-san and I went to the Stratfo hideout to save you...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kagari-san died there... but she took several of them with her.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Dr. Leskinen was the only one to escape...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Amadeus was deleted, too.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“This is all just too much, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But now you’re our only hope.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Please... I know it’s horrible to just leave this all to you, but...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Please, reach Steins Gate no matter what.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Ok, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Farewell—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
I woke up on top of blankets laid out on the floor of a hospital.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
The rooms, and even the halls outside, were overflowing with wounded people.[%p]
There weren’t enough beds, so there were blankets placed on the floor.[%p]
Dove mi trovavo?[%p]
I thought I was back to the other linea di universo, with the war.[%p]
But I wasn’t.[%p]
According to the news on TV, there had been a terror attack in Akihabara.[%p]
A special forces group from another country had gone on a rampage, and it was like something out of a war.[%p]
The incident had come to an end and the mystery special forces unit disappeared, but many were dead or wounded after the battle.[%p]
I didn’t really remember how I got here.[%p]
The last thing I remembered was being locked up and horribly tortured by Leskinen.[%p]
My whole body ached, in fact.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Ok, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Farewell—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...”[%p]
And then I remembered what Maho had said to me in that dream.[%p]
Was that real...?[%p]
Maho had saved me?[%p]
And... had she mentioned Kagari?[%p]
I patted down my pockets and found my phone was still there.[%p]
I tried to call Mayuri.[%p]
If that dream was real, Mayuri was missing.[%p]
But that was impossible.[%p]
I’d chosen this linea di universo so that Mayuri would survive![%p]
If nothing else, it was guaranteed that she’d make it to 2036.[%p]
She couldn’t die today in 2011.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri... answer me...!”[%p]
But no matter how many times I called, she didn’t pick up.[%p]
I forced myself to stand up and leave the hospital room.[%p]
I went out to the roof.[%p]
It seemed I was at the Ochanomizu hospital where Fubuki had stayed before.[%p]
The morning sky was amazingly clear.[%p]
I could see Akihabara in the far distance.[%p]
There were pillars of smoke rising up.[%p]
I shivered at the strange sight.[%p]
Even from here, I could tell how fierce the battle must have been.[%p]
The world’s history was proceeding as John Titor had prophesied.[%p]
I tried calling Mayuri again from the roof, but nobody picked up.[%p]
My next move was to call Daru out of desperation.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hello? Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru...!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Good, you’re alive...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You, too. I’m glad you’re safe.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Things were surprisingly quiet by the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you now?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“On the run. I left Akihabara.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Capisco...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ve gotten in touch with both Faris-tan and Luka-shi. Both of them say they’ve evacuated.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can’t find Mayu-shi or Suzuha...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And the time machine was completely destroyed yesterday. There’s nothing left, not even a piece of scrap.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Things are moving so much faster than Suzuha told us they would.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
So it wasn’t a dream after all.[%p]
While I was unconscious, Maho had said her goodbye.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Daru...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Am I... Am I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...not allowed to live a normal life?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was ready for this to happen...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m the one who chose a world where the Third World War occurred, instead of Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I never thought I’d survive and everyone else would die...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t fair.”[%p]
Were the laws of God never going to forgive me, no matter what?[%p]
Was it that much of a sin to escape the wheel of fate?[%p]
If it was, then why not just curse me?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m going... to make a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t have a choice.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can’t let it end this way!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What are you going to do, Okarin?”[%p]
The smoke was still rising over Akihabara.[%p]
I stared at it in shock.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Io...”[%p]
The tears welled up.[%p]
I fell to the ground.[%p]
I didn’t have the strength to stand up.[%p]
I couldn’t answer Daru’s question.[%p]
No matter how hard you try, no matter how much you work to change things, everything converges back to the way God wants it.[%p]
You’re wasting your time struggling against it, Daru.[%p]
I’m so tired...[%p]
I need to sleep a little.[%p]
There’s still a few years before the Third World War really begins.[%p]
And there’s 14 years before I die.[%p]
I’ll live my life averting my eyes from reality, and not wasting my time with a fight that can’t be won.[%p]
That’s the only end that’s fitting for a person like me.[%p]
I’m sorry, Maho.[%p]
I’m sorry, Mayuri.[%p]
I’m sorry, Kurisu.[%p]
Forgive me... for giving up here...[%p]
