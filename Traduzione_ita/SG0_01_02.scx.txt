Hiyajo Maho was remembering.[%p]
She was remembering the last night she’d spoken to Makise Kurisu in person.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Seriously, why do I have to do this now, of all times—”[%p]
That night, Kurisu was whispering to herself a lot.[%p]
Viktor Chondria University’s Brain Science Institute.[%p]
Maho and Kurisu worked in the same room at the lab.[%p]
Thus, Maho was forced to hear Kurisu’s angry mumblings whether she wanted to or not.[%p]
A little was fine, but she’d been acting like this all day, and it was keeping Maho from concentrating. She finally snapped and turned away from the paper she was writing.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Hey, Kurisu.”[%p]
English was the language most commonly used at Viktor Chondria University.[%p]
When the other staff and professors were around, she’d always use English, but when it was just her and Kurisu, Maho would often speak in Japanese.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Would you stop it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? Stop what?”[%p]
Kurisu stopped messing with her luggage and turned around.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re so loud that I can’t concentrate. I need to turn this paper in by tomorrow.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Was I... talking to myself?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Want me to sue you for violating the local noise ordinance?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sorry.”[%p]
Kurisu apologized and started to scratch the back of her head.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho decided to calm down by standing up and going to the shelf where the research notes were kept. There were several books she needed for her paper.[%p]
But they were all up on the top shelf.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Grr...”[%p]
“This must be someone’s idea of a prank,” she’d said, as she stared up at a heavy book.[%p]
She decided to try and reach for it, but no matter how she stood on her toes, she came nowhere close.[%p]
Her tiny little arms seemed to her like dead branches waving in the wind. She bit her lip.[%p]
After she’d skipped grades to go to college, and then come to work at this lab, she’d had more chances than ever before to hate her small stature.[%e]
Whenever she walked outside after dark, the cops would stop her. Even with her ID, she couldn’t get into bars, and buying medicine and alcohol at drug stores was a pain.[%p]
The most humiliating part was that no matter where she went, everyone thought she was in middle school. Nobody believed her when she said she was 20.[%p]
Everything in America was just too big.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, shall I get that for you?”[%p]
Kurisu noticed the trouble Maho was having and came over.[%p]
But Maho was stubborn, and decided to pretend nothing was wrong.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s fine. I’m not having any problems.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sure you are.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Am not.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re sure?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m sure.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But there’s a book on this shelf I want, too, so...”[%p]
Kurisu easily reached up to the highest shelf and grabbed the book Maho wanted.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...It must be nice to be tall.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, I’m not really that—Oh.”[%p]
Kurisu covered her mouth when she realized she’d said something she shouldn’t have.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thanks, that was a big help. If you need something in Japan, tell me. I’ll send it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I will. Thank you.”[%p]
Kurisu handed over the book as she spoke.[%p]
And then suddenly, her eyes went wide and began to sparkle.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Senpai, about what we were just talking about...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What were we just talking about?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Talking to yourself.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh? Oh...”[%p]
It looked like Kurisu had come up with a new idea.[%p]
This was a regular occurrence for Kurisu, and Maho was used to it.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wouldn’t that be proof of a self?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“For Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, if she started talking to herself, I’d be pretty surprised.”[%p]
No matter how advanced an AI was, it wouldn’t talk to itself unless you programmed it to do that. And there was no need, or even a point, to a feature like that.[%p]
If an AI started talking to itself, that might be a good indication that there was a “self” to talk to.[%p]
But Maho hesitated to agree with her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“You should watch what you say here.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t forget that there are a lot of people who think that a soul is something God gives to humanity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s right, isn’t it?”[%p]
Kurisu’s expression dimmed.[%p]
Kurisu and Maho were both treated as heretics in the lab.[%p]
Especially since they were Japanese and women.[%e]
And Kurisu was simply too talented.[%p]
Nobody ever actually did anything, but a lot of the older scientists were definitely avoiding her.[%p]
Dr. Leskinen was the chief scientist, and the fact that he liked the two of them was all that let them do their research in peace.[%p]
If the other scientists heard what Kurisu had just said, who knows what they’d do.[%p]
Maho patted Kurisu on the shoulder.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Well, go have a good time in Japan and refresh yourself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m still not happy about that.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Why? I think you’ll have fun.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If I’m doing an exchange, it should be to a graduate school. Why high school?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It has to be high school, right? By Japanese standards you should still be in high school.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Just accept that the professor is doing something nice for you.”[%p]
Maho remembered what Dr. Leskinen had said.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—Kurisu has a fragile personality. All the bickering in the lab is putting her under a lot of stress, and she’s at her limit. It might ruin her as a researcher.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That’s what the professor had said. He was really worried about her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“And you have to go to Japan in July anyway, right? So it’s perfect timing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah. I’m actually kind of down about that, too.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The Akihabara Techno Forum. Was that it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m still not used to giving lectures. I don’t know what to do.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Now that you’re published in ‘Science,’ expect a lot more of this. You need to practice.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I’d rather not.”[%p]
Kurisu whispered to herself.[%p]
Maho didn’t like being around lots of other people either, so she knew how Kurisu felt.[%p]
But there were a lot of scientists who wanted to be published in a major journal, then go on to give public lectures.[%p]
And she’d beaten out many of them to win that honor. People were jealous.[%p]
She needed to fulfill her responsibilities, even if just to shut them up.[%e]
—Maybe I’m not that much better, though.[%p]
Maho silently laughed a little, and hated herself for doing it.[%p]
“Maybe I’m just as jealous as they are...” That feeling, which was a little like fear, was something that she always felt.[%e]
The girl in front of her was just that different from Maho.[%p]
Someone she could never reach, no matter how hard she tried.[%p]
Someone who’d surpassed everything she’d ever done almost instantly.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Senpai?”[%p]
Kurisu was peering into her face, confused. Maho felt flustered.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Um... uh...! Are you meeting your dad in Japan?”[%p]
She’d heard that Kurisu’s parents weren’t divorced, but that they were separated. Her mom was still in America, and her dad was in Japan.[%p]
After Maho said it, she’d wondered if that was too personal a question.[%p]
But Kurisu smiled a little.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Actually, I got an invitation from him.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, yeah?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He’s announcing a new theory this summer. I’m thinking of going to see the announcement.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A new theory?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh...”[%p]
Kurisu’s smile changed into a small expression of consternation.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I haven’t heard the details yet. I know it’s got something to do with the [color index="280AA02D1400"]theory of relativity[color index="800000"]...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah?”[%p]
Maho felt like she was hiding something, but didn’t question her anymore.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Anyway, take care. I’ll be expecting presents.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you want?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hmm, since you’re going to Akihabara, why not something rare? You know a lot about Akihabara, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? Why do you say that?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re always reading those sites during breaks.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wha—?!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Did Amadeus tell you that?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“She wouldn’t do that. Sometimes I’m right behind you and you’re so busy watching videos that you don’t even notice.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Aaahhh! I can’t believe you found out. Damn my carelessness!”[%p]
Kurisu actually seemed upset for once.[%p]
This really surprised Maho.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Senpai, please, don’t tell the others...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t think it’s really something you need to hide, but...”[%p]
The idea of sharing a secret with Kurisu made Maho happy.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Got it. I won’t tell anyone.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks so much...”[%p]
Kurisu seemed genuinely relieved. Maho continued.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Hey...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Once you get back from Japan, let’s find out if Amadeus can talk to herself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okay!”[%p]
Kurisu had a very happy look on her face.[%p]
It was the face of a born scientist, who loved to explore the unknown more than anything in the world. Her smile was as innocent as that of a child who’d just been given a new toy. It was very beautiful.[%p]
And it was one of the reasons that Maho liked the younger researcher quite a bit.[%e]
...But...[%p]
The promise the two of them made would never be fulfilled.[%p]
In fact, they would never even meet again.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
It felt like she was thinking about Kurisu more and more since she’d come to Japan.[%p]
Maho didn’t know if it was because she was in Japan, or because she was talking with the Amadeus [Kurisu] more often.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Or maybe...[%p]
Was it because she’d met the young man named Okabe Rintaro?[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“He knows things about Kurisu that I don’t, huh...”[%p]
Thinking back, the first day they’d met she’d broken down and cried right in front of him.[%p]
It was something she didn’t really want to remember. She chased the memories away out of embarrassment.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You were thinking of Okabe-san, weren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...?!”[%p]
She snapped her head toward the PC monitor.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Heheh.”[%p]
Maho was in the middle of a conversation with [Kurisu].[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, that’s right.”[%p]
She shrugged her shoulders and tried to ignore [Kurisu]’s mischievous smile.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t you think it’s strange that Dr. Leskinen’s got such a high opinion of him?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“He handed over your access rights to a guy he’d only met twice.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Is it really wise to trust him so much?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“He looked like a nice person.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah? I can’t tell if he’s got any ambitions or not... I feel like I don’t really understand him.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Do you like him?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Would you cut it out?”[%p]
Maho brought her face close to the monitor and glared.[%p]
[margin top="76"]But [Kurisu] seemed unconcerned.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“There’s no real need to hide it, is there?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I can understand why you didn’t want to say anything yesterday when he was right in front of you, but now it’s just the two of us.”[%p]
Kurisu may not have looked like someone who would, but she really enjoyed this sort of gossip. Maybe “girl talk” was the right word.[%p]
Maho sighed and sat back in her chair.[%p]
The creaking sound echoed throughout the empty office.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I really don’t feel that way about him. I still don’t even really know who he is.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I see. Well, that makes sense.”[%p]
[Kurisu] let the matter drop.[%p]
This bothered Maho a little.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“But what does interest me...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No, it’s nothing.”[%p]
Maho had been spending a lot of time thinking about something since yesterday, to the point where she’d even put off her research.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—What kind of relationship was there between Kurisu and Okabe?[%p]
[margin top="38"]—What was Kurisu feeling in the days before she died?[%p]
[margin top="38"]She would’ve liked to ask Okabe, if she could.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Senpai, did my original and Okabe-san know each other?”[%p]
Maho shivered. It was as if [Kurisu] had been reading her mind.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“How could you tell?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I came to that conclusion after listening to Okabe-san and hearing your response.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“It’s all just circumstantial evidence, but do you want me to show my proof anyway?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s fine. Knowing you, the conclusion is perfect.”[%p]
The way they used words like “proof” in normal conversation showed that both Maho and Kurisu were scientists at heart.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“If he has memories of me that I don’t possess, that’s likely to cause problems with our conversations.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’ll leave it up to you how to deal with it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“He may bring it up, possibly. And if you want, you can ask him.”[%p]
Maho still didn’t know if Okabe would even access Amadeus at all. They weren’t forcing him to.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hmm... feigning ignorance is the same as lying, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I should be able to get some good data, I think.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Yes, it was interesting.[%p]
But that was her opinion, as a researcher working on Amadeus.[%p]
[margin top="38"]How would Okabe Rintaro feel about it?[%p]
Wouldn’t this be rubbing salt on the wounds in his heart?[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho realized she was getting much too sentimental.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Maybe it’s because I’m in Japan...”[%p]
It’d been a week since she’d arrived. The first thing she’d planned to do was offer flowers.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But she still couldn’t bring herself to visit the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Akihabara Radio Kaikan[color index="800000"], the place where Kurisu had died.[%e]
