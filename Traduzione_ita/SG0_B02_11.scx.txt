As soon as we left the building, I could see a car coming down the empty alleyway. It was a big American RV.[%p]
We quickly hid ourselves in the shadow of another building.[%p]
My intuition was right.[%p]
The RV stopped in front of the building we’d just left.[%p]
Three men came out.[%p]
None of them were Japanese.[%p]
They were all dressed in black suits, almost like [color index="280AA02D1400"]MIB[color index="800000"]s.[%p]
Whatever they were, they weren’t Akihabara tourists.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That was close...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho went pale when she saw the men go into the building.[%p]
She seemed to be shaking a little, too.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“This is like... a movie. I can’t believe it’s real.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How’d they find out about that place, though?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You sure you didn’t screw up somehow, Daru?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Who do you think I am?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A super hacka, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hacker. Right. I make sure I don’t get caught.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Either that, or Hiyajo-san and I were tailed...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t scare me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They raided your office and hotel room in Wako City. I’m sure they’ve been watching you this whole time.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, right.”[%p]
Maho seemed to suddenly remember something. She took out her smartphone and made a call.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I need to contact the professor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You should tell him to hide somewhere for today. If we meet up with him, it could put him in danger.”[%p]
Maho nodded.[%p]
