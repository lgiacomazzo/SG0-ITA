Per la prima volta in quasi quattro mesi, mi sentivo come se il mondo intero si stesse contorcendo.[%p]
Chi era stato?[%p]
Chi aveva cambiato la linea di universo?![%p]
Io non ho fatto nulla. Non avevo interferito con il mondo.[%p]
Allora perché il mondo mi stava facendo questo?![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Aprii gli occhi.[%p]
Tutto aveva già assunto colori diversi.[%p]
Il mondo continuò a ondeggiare, finché ancora una volta si fissò su un unico punto nel tempo.[%p]
Non stavo più guardando una festa calda e allegra nel laboratorio.[%p]
Ero fuori.[%p]
Stava piovendo.[%p]
La pioggia mi cadeva sulla faccia, in gocce così grandi da far male.[%p]
Era una pioggia di metà inverno. Faceva freddissimo, e potevo sentire che mi stava togliendo le forze dal corpo.[%p]
La mia vista smise di contorcersi.[%p]
Fissavo la schiena larga di un uomo che non conoscevo.[%p]
Potevo sentire il suono di molti stivali che calpestavano il fango, mescolandosi alla pioggia che cadeva.[%p]
La puzza era terribile. L’odore dei liquami era così forte che faceva male respirare. Ed era mescolato con l’orribile odore di gomma e plastica bruciata.[%p]
Dove mi trovavo? Cosa stavo facendo adesso?[%p]
Le cose intorno a me erano cambiate moltissimo.[%p]
Cercai di capire la situazione in cui mi trovavo, ma il mio cervello faceva fatica a tenere il passo.[%p]
[name]Voce di un uomo[line]“Siamo quasi arrivati. Tieni duro.”[%p]
Quando mi fermai, una mano ruvida mi diede una pacca incoraggiante sulla spalla.[%p]
Mi guardai intorno e vidi un uomo della mia età, con un viso forte e potente.[%p]
Era una faccia che non avevo mai visto. Non lo conoscevo... probabilmente.[%p]
L’uomo indossava la divisa mimetica e l’equipaggiamento che avevo spesso visto indossare dalle Forze di Autodifesa al telegiornale. Portava un fucile d’assalto sulla spalla.[%p]
Intorno a me c’erano sette o otto persone, tutte vestite allo stesso modo.[%p]
Erano in formazione circolare con me al centro e camminavano in avanti silenziosamente, mentre tenevano d’occhio l’area intorno a loro.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](Queste persone... fanno parte delle Forze di Autodifesa?)[%p]
E in quel momento mi sono reso conto che...[%p]
Indossavo la loro stessa divisa mimetica.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](Anch’io sono nella SDF?!)[%p]
Toccai il mio bicipite per controllare, ma non c’era nessun muscolo. Era flaccido e debole. A differenza degli altri, non portavo armi.[%p]
Allora cosa stava succedendo qui?[%p]
Sembrava che questi sette o otto ragazzi della SDF dall’aspetto duro mi stessero facendo la guardia...[%p]
Da quando sono così importante?[%p]
Ancora confuso, mi sono trascinato avanti.[%p]
Dove mi trovavo, comunque?[%p]
È stato un lungo percorso pieno di fango marrone scuro.[%p]
I muri formavano un’alta silhouette a sinistra e a destra.[%p]
Il sentiero era pieno di spazzatura e macerie di cemento, e a volte dovevamo farci strada a forza.[%p]
Guardai in alto, oltre le alte mura. Nonostante la pioggia, la luna nel cielo notturno era stranamente rossa e un po’ troppo luminosa.[%p]
Era grazie alla luna che potevamo percorrere un sentiero come questo senza torce.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh?”[%p]
Un suono. Sentii un suono.[%p]
Era... il suono dell’acqua.[%p]
Guardai e vidi un buco aperto in una delle pareti. L’acqua sporca si stava riversando fuori. L’acqua formava decine di piccoli fiumi che ci bloccavano il cammino.[%p]
Allora si trattava di questo. Era il fondo di un fiume che si era prosciugato. Quelli che sembravano alte mura erano le dighe del fiume.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Dove ci troviamo?!”[%p]
Mi voltai verso l’uomo che mi aveva parlato poco prima, e gridai in modo che la mia voce potesse essere sentita sopra la pioggia.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Ssh! Non fare troppi rumori.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, mi dispiace...”[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Abbiamo quasi attraversato il centro della città. Se riusciamo ad arrivare al presidio di Nerima, ci sarà una macchina ad aspettarti. Quindi continua a camminare—”[%p]
Però—le sue parole si sono interrotte lì.[%p]
Tutti sembravano più tesi che mai.[%p]
Uno di loro mi afferrò e mi spinse verso il lato del letto del fiume.[%p]
Tutti misero la schiena contro il muro e trattennero il respiro.[%p]
Potevo sentire il rumore dei rotori di un elicottero in lontananza.[%p]
No, più di uno.[%p]
Si stavano avvicinando.[%p]
Non avevo idea di cosa stesse succedendo, ma potevo sentire il mio cuore iniziare a battere più velocemente.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Mettiti nell’ombra di quella macchina.”[%p]
Dopo diversi metri di macerie c’era un’auto rovesciata.[%p]
Doveva essere caduta nel letto del fiume dopo che l’acqua era scomparsa. L’intera carrozzeria era piegata verso l’interno, e il tettuccio era completamente schiacciato.[%p]
Mi sdraiai nel fango puzzolente e strisciai verso l’ombra dell’auto rovesciata.[%p]
Allo stesso tempo, i soldati della SDF si stavano dando ordini a vicenda, come se fosse qualcosa che avevano già pianificato.[%p]
Due di loro sono rimasti al mio fianco, mentre tutti gli altri sono tornati di corsa da dove eravamo venuti.[%p]
Tutti si arrampicarono su crepe e affioramenti del muro, poi sparirono oltre il bordo dell’argine e fuori dalla mia vista.[%p]
Poco dopo...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Quelli erano... spari.[%p]
E non solo un singolo colpo di pistola, o qualcosa del genere.[%p]
Era il suono della guerra.[%p]
Potevo sentire gli elicotteri allontanarsi, attirati dagli spari.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Oh no.”[%p]
In questa linea di universo, il Giappone era... in guerra?[%p]
—La Terza Guerra Mondiale.[%p]
Ricordai le parole di Suzuha.[%p]
Mi è capitato di guardare dentro l’auto distrutta...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Potevo vedere i cadaveri di un uomo, una donna e un bambino piccolo appesi a testa in giù, ancora attaccati alle loro cinture di sicurezza.[%p]
Erano tutti coperti di sangue nero e secco. Sembravano manichini di una brutta casa stregata.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aaah... Aaah...”[%p]
E in quel momento ho capito...[%p]
Ero stato così concentrato ad andare avanti che non avevo notato cosa fossero, ma avevo visto simili “manichini” sprofondati nel fango...[%p]
Potevo vedere le loro braccia, le ossa e i muscoli lacerati esposti all’aria, protesi verso il cielo come se cercassero la salvezza.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
Misi la mano sulla bocca per soffocare un urlo.[%p]
Quelli non erano manichini...![%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Ora! Mettetevi lungo il lato del muro e muovetevi!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Stiamo cambiando il percorso. Forza, alzati.”[%p]
Mi tirò su. Le mie ginocchia tremavano per lo shock e la stanchezza.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Gli altri stanno attirando via gli elicotteri [color index="280AA02D1400"]Sovietici[color index="800000"], ma non durerà a lungo. Sbrigati.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gli elicotteri Sovietici?”[%p]
La mia mente era offuscata dal terrore, ma sembrava che ci fosse qualcosa di strano in quello che aveva appena detto.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Riprenditi. Sai quante persone sono morte per proteggerti?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Proteggere... me? Perché?”[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Non ci è stato detto perché. Ma ci è stato detto di dare la vita per te, se necessario. E che tu potresti cambiare il futuro di questo paese.”[%p]
Un elicottero passò sopra il letto del fiume. Il faro luminoso passò per un momento, ma per fortuna l’ombra dell’argine ci nascose.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Da questa parte.”[%p]
Il giovane soldato della SDF, di cui non sapevo nemmeno il nome, mi tirò dentro uno dei buchi nel cemento.[%p]
Quando guardai da vicino, capii che era l’entrata di una fogna.[%p]
Era grande abbastanza per il passaggio di una sola persona.[%p]
Lottando contro il flusso d’acqua che mi arrivava alle ginocchia, mi spinsi avanti nell’oscurità.[%p]
Il mio senso dell’olfatto era già diventato insensibile, quindi non dovevo preoccuparmi del fetore delle fogne.[%p]
Una volta dentro, abbiamo trovato diversi sentieri ramificati.[%p]
I soldati dell’SDF sembravano sapere quale portava dove, e hanno marciato senza esitazione.[%p]
Poi siamo usciti dalla fogna e siamo tornati nel letto di un fiume.[%p]
Era prosciugato, proprio come quello che avevamo appena attraversato.[%p]
Non sapevo se fosse lo stesso fiume o un altro, e i due soldati non me l’hanno detto.[%p]
In ogni caso, ero contento di essere finalmente fuori dall’oscurità puzzolente, e cercai di fare un respiro profondo e riempire i miei polmoni di aria fresca.[%p]
Però—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh... ah...?”[%p]
A metà mi resi conto che il letto del fiume puzzava anche peggio della fogna. Feci involontariamente un passo indietro, e poi un altro.[%p]
La vista di fronte a me era proprio terribile.[%p]
Quello che una volta era un letto del fiume era ora pieno di corpi.[%p]
Alcuni di essi erano stati bruciati fino a diventare completamente neri, quindi era impossibile dire quanta morte ci fosse davanti a me.[%p]
E in lontananza, potevo vedere quelli che sembravano dei falò.[%p]
Bruciavano nonostante la pioggia.[%p]
I fuochi stavano consumando le montagne di carne che una volta erano corpi umani.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Siamo quasi arrivati. So che è dura, ma puoi correre?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh? Uh... sì.”[%p]
Il soldato della SDF mi parlò.[%p]
E poi tornai in me.[%p]
Se non fosse stato per questi due, non sarei riuscito a rimanere sano di mente.[%p]
Abbiamo corso attraverso il letto del fiume, uno di loro davanti a me, l’altro dietro.[%p]
Sentivo il ronzio costante degli elicotteri sopra di me. A volte i riflettori si avvicinavano molto.[%p]
Ogni volta che lo facevano, mi nascondevo tra le pile di corpi finché non passavano.[%p]
L’avevo già visto molte volte mentre vagavo per le linee di universo.[%p]
Avevo visto la morte.[%p]
Avevo visto i momenti in cui la gente moriva.[%p]
Ma allo stesso tempo, non avevo mai visto cosa succedeva a una persona morta dopo che era stata abbandonata per molto tempo.[%p]
Più che la paura, più che il dolore, la cosa che mi colpì per prima fu l’odore della morte.[%p]
L’odore di putrefazione stava divorando il mio corpo, non la mia anima.[%p]
Tutto il mio corpo lo stava rifiutando.[%p]
Mi faceva sentire male.[%p]
Pensare così significava calpestare la dignità dei morti, ma non potevo farne a meno.[%p]
“La Valle di Hinnom.”[%p]
Ricordai quella frase.[%p]
Era quello che aveva detto quello strano aggressore quella notte, quando era venuto a cercare il dottor Leskinen, Maho e me.[%p]
[name]Aggressore[line]“È meglio per te entrare nella vita con un occhio solo che essere gettato con due occhi nella ardente Valle di Hinnom!”[%p]
Quella valle fu l’origine della parola Gehenna, ovvero “inferno”. Si diceva che le fiamme bruciassero lì ogni notte, infiammando il cielo stesso.[%p]
Coloro che morivano senza pietà con la rabbia o la miseria nel cuore venivano gettati nelle fiamme, le loro anime diventavano fumo nero che faceva piovere l’odio sulla terra.[%p]
Ciò che stavo fissando ora era Gehenna.[%p]
I due soldati mi condussero in un tunnel della metropolitana mezzo crollato.[%p]
Le luci erano tutte spente perché non c’era elettricità, ma c’erano tre auto blindate con colori mimetici, e i fari accesi per illuminare la strada.[%p]
Erano veicoli fuoristrada a quattro ruote motrici, coperti da spessi pezzi di armatura, ma non vidi nessuna vera arma.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“You can take the subway route to escape to Saitama. I hear it’s still safe at [color index="280AA02D1400"]Iruma Base[color index="800000"]. If you can get that far, you should be able to escape Kanto.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Escape... Kanto...?”[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Ask them about it. For now, just hurry.”[%p]
There were a lot of things I wanted to ask, but even as we spoke I heard what sounded like gunshots outside the tunnel. The men forced me into the back seat of one of the cars.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Goodbye. I’ll be praying for your safety.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? What about you guys?”[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“We have another mission to carry out. Farewell.”[%p]
The two soldiers who had brought me here saluted, then turned around and left the station.[%p]
I felt like I was never going to see them again.[%p]
The door of the armored car slammed shut with a heavy thud.[%p]
The car’s crew were SDF soldiers, just a little older than me.[%p]
The diesel engine kicked to life, and the car raced down a tunnel that had originally been designed for trains.[%p]
Of course, it wasn’t a pleasant ride at all, but I didn’t have any choice.[%p]
There was no way I could tell them I wanted to go to Akihabara.[%p]
I had no way to alter the linea di universo.[%p]
I had to survive in this hellish world.[%p]
And to survive, I needed to do what they said.[%p]
My wants didn’t matter at all. I wasn’t even allowed to express them.[%p]
I just did as they told me and ran.[%p]
It was all I could do.[%p]
But I had no idea that it would take an entire month.[%p]
The reason it took a month to get to Okinawa was that we were losing the war.[%p]
Supposedly, the plan had been to ferry me by plane to Okinawa once I’d arrived at Iruma Base.[%p]
But the constant bombing had slowed us down, so they gave up on the plane and decided I would escape to Kyushu by ground.[%p]
There was more than one attack by Soviet spies and assault teams. Some of the SDF soldiers protecting me died.[%p]
But when I got to Sasebo, I was able to get on a maritime SDF escort ship, and managed to escape to Okinawa.[%p]
Why were they doing all this for me?[%p]
No matter how many times I asked, no one would answer.[%p]
Okinawa in winter was covered in thick clouds.[%p]
Come to think of it, I hadn’t seen a real break in the clouds for a whole month.[%p]
I was thinking about that when I was loaded into a van with dark-tinted windows that had come to pick me up from the port.[%p]
Inside the car was not only the driver, but a middle-aged man sitting in the front passenger seat.[%p]
He was very short, perhaps only around 150 centimeters tall.[%p]
But he had the air of a military veteran, and even though he was fully dressed, I could tell he was extremely muscular.[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“Okabe Rintaro-kun, correct?”[%p]
[name]Personale della SDF[line]“I’m Shimoyama, with the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Ministero della Difesa[color index="800000"]’s Intelligence Security Command.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“We’re going to make a stop at the airport, and then head to the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Ufficio della difesa di Okinawa[color index="800000"] in Kadena. I’m sure you’re tired from your long journey, but I’ll have to ask you to hang in there a while longer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Right.”[%p]
I’d heard that Tokyo had been destroyed.[%p]
The major functions of the Japanese government were now headquartered out of the Ufficio della difesa di Okinawa, to allow for better cooperation with the American forces stationed nearby.[%p]
That’s what Shimoyama explained to me.[%p]
In other words, the place I was heading to was the core of Japan’s defenses.[%p]
Once I arrived, would I understand why I was so important that all those soldiers were willing to die to protect me?[%p]
The car stopped in front of [color index="280AA02D1400"]aeroporto di Naha[color index="800000"] for a while.[%p]
And then I saw a surprising pair get aboard.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“O-Okabe-san!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Wow, it’s really Okarin-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re... Yuki-san and Nakase-san!”[%p]
I wasn’t expecting to see them there.[%p]
But they were the first people I knew who I’d met since coming to this linea di universo.[%p]
That alone was almost enough to make me cry.[%p]
But still, I couldn’t just sit there and be happy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about Mayuri? Do you know where she is?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Sta bene.”[%p]
Yuki nodded, as if trying to make me feel better.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“She was just with us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just with you?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“That’s right. Mayushii, and Rumiho-chan, and Luka-kun, and Kaede-chan.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“We got to the airport this morning. We were all waiting because they said we could go to some place called the Defense Bureau, where we’d be safe.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“They just said they’d take Fubuki-chan and me there first...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“And then they had us get inside this car, where we found you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, I’m glad everybody’s safe.”[%p]
Since Daru and Suzuha weren’t mentioned, I was going to ask about them, but...[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Sorry, but can you talk about this later?”[%p]
Shimoyama cut me off, and the car started moving.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“The plan is for your families to arrive at the Ufficio della difesa di Okinawa eventually. We already have them under our protection.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“R-Really?! I’m so glad...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Your other friends are all in the car behind us. You haven’t been separated, so don’t worry.”[%p]
I took a quick look, and saw another identical van a little behind us.[%p]
So Mayuri and the others were there?[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Then we’ll see them later, right?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Of course.”[%p]
Yuki let out a sigh of relief.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
But then I started to wonder about something else.[%p]
Why were we split into different cars?[%p]
This van could hold at least another three people. If we squeezed tight it could easily hold everyone.[%p]
Or was there some reason they’d put me, Yuki, and Fubuki into the same car?[%p]
The car drove alongside the [color index="280AA02D1400"]monorotaia di Okinawa[color index="800000"] for a while, and then went south down a wide bypass.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s so dark...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? What was that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing, just... there are all these stores... but they’re all dark.”[%p]
There were lots of franchise restaurants, big supermarkets, cafeterias for tourists, and rent-a-car places all jammed together along the side of the road.[%p]
But all of them were dead silent, and their lights were turned off.[%p]
Barely any of the street lights were turned on, and the only cars were Japanese and US military vehicles. I didn’t see anyone out walking.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“There’s a blackout in effect, as well as a curfew past 5:00 PM.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Okinawa may be safe, but this is still wartime. Things can’t be like they were.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I can’t wait for the war to end and everything to go back to normal.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Wartime, huh?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tell me, Okabe-kun. The Okinawa you knew was a bright, fun place, even at night, wasn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, I wouldn’t know. I’ve never been to Okinawa before.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“That’s a shame. Then I pray you get to come back for a good vacation sometime. This really is a nice island.”[%p]
The car headed up from the bypass over a land bridge, and then to another road. We quickly came to a long tunnel.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I actually wanted to ask the three of you some questions before we got to the Bureau. That’s why I have you riding with me.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
My guess was right.[%p]
That meant there was something he wanted to ask just the three of us.[%p]
But why us three?[%p]
I wasn’t particularly close to Yuki or Fubuki.[%p]
I’d only even started talking to them a few months ago—[%p]
And then I shook my head.[%p]
That was before the linea di universo changed.[%p]
Maybe things were different in this linea di universo.[%p]
I had no idea what my relationship was to anyone else in this linea di universo.[%p]
Since the SDF had been treating me so well, I didn’t want to make Shimoyama suspicious.[%p]
I decided it would be best to leave most of the talking to Yuki and Fubuki.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Amane Yuki-san.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Y-Yes?”[%p]
Shimoyama spoke to Yuki first.[%p]
Yuki went stiff when her name was called. I could feel it even sitting next to her.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“You don’t know where Hashida Itaru-kun and his little sister are, do you?”[%p]
Little sister...[%p]
That must be Suzuha.[%p]
That would mean that even in this linea di universo Suzuha had come from the future, and gotten to know Yuki and the others while pretending to be Daru’s sister.[%p]
And the SDF evidently didn’t know where Daru and Suzuha were.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“No, I...”[%p]
Yuki fell silent and glanced over to me, as if expecting help.[%p]
But I didn’t know where they were, either.[%p]
I didn’t even have any memories of this linea di universo, so I had no way of answering.[%p]
But Yuki’s attitude bothered me.[%p]
It was as if she knew where they were and was deliberately hiding it, and that I was supposed to be hiding it, too.[%p]
I could figure that out, I’m sure Shimoyama could, too.[%p]
A strange tension filled the car.[%p]
Yuki was trying to hide it? From whom?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Hmm? You’re sure you don’t know?”[%p]
Shimoyama turned around from the front passenger seat and asked again.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I’m sorry.”[%p]
Yuki bowed her head in apology.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“But you were very close to him, weren’t you? You were his lover, and yet you heard nothing?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You know that cell phones don’t work anymore, right?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“There are plenty of ways to get in touch with someone besides a cell phone.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But I really don’t...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Nothing from his sister, either?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“By the way, I’m told that you were researching something with Hashida-kun, Okabe-kun?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
I wasn’t sure how to react when the conversation suddenly turned toward me.[%p]
Researching? Researching what?[%p]
Uh-oh. If I panic, I’ll make them suspicious.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“What were you researching?”[%p]
I would just have to give him the most harmless answers I could.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It wasn’t really research... it was more like... inventions.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Inventions?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like whether you could attach a [color index="280AA02D1400"]telecamera CCD[color index="800000"] to a bamboo copter to do aerial photography...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Or whether you could use the heat from a vacuum cleaner as a hair dryer...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Oh? That’s interesting.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Then you weren’t, say, making something unbelievable, and running away from us so that we wouldn’t find out what it was?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fuggendo?”[%p]
Damn. I responded.[%p]
That was a mistake.[%p]
But did that mean that Daru and Suzuha were hiding from the SDF amidst all this chaos?[%p]
The SDF had risked their lives to protect me over the past month.[%p]
Shouldn’t I be asking them for help?[%p]
I got even more confused.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“If you don’t know, then that’s fine. We’ll talk about Hashida-kun and his sister some other time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Somebody, please tell me what the right answer is.[%p]
How am I supposed to respond here?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Um... Nakase Katsumi-san? There was something else I wanted to ask you.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“M-Me?”[%p]
This time it was Fubuki’s turn to jump up in her seat.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No, no. Don’t get so nervous. It’s nothing big.”[%p]
Or so Shimoyama said, but Fubuki was clearly starting to get scared.[%p]
Her reaction was strange. It was too strong.[%p]
Maybe the Forze di autodifesa weren’t simply protecting us.[%p]
For one thing, there was no way normal civilians like us merited such important treatment.[%p]
But then what were they after?[%p]
No, I could guess.[%p]
The time machine.[%p]
This war started with Russia’s time machine experiments.[%p]
And of course, Nakabachi was involved. I’d learned from some of the soldiers that even in this linea di universo he’d sought asylum in Russia.[%p]
And Suzuha was a time traveler from the year 2036.[%p]
If Suzuha was here in this era, that meant that it was Daru who made the time machine that brought her here.[%p]
If you had a time machine, you could change the outcome of this war.[%p]
It would make sense if that’s what the Japanese government thought, and if that was why they were trying to capture Daru, Suzuha, and their friends.[%p]
Once I realized that, the whole situation started to feel terrifying to me.[%p]
Was this car really headed toward the Ufficio della difesa di Okinawa?[%p]
And if it was, were they really going to keep us safe there?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“About the physical you underwent last week...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“W-Was there some problem?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No. You’ve almost recovered from the wounds you sustained in Tokyo, and health-wise, you’re fine. But you’re under a lot of stress.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Well, it’s not surprising. You survived that terrible bombing. It’s no exaggeration to say that most civilians have [color index="280AA02D1400"]PTSD[color index="800000"] now.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“But it seems that your symptoms are a little different than most people’s.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Hai dei sogni molto realistici, per esempio.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“In casi particolarmente gravi, potrebbero quasi essere chiamati sogni ad occhi aperti... Mi hanno detto che a volte si perde la capacità di distinguere i sogni dalla realtà.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Isn’t that just PTSD, though?”[%p]
Fubuki was too scared to speak, so Yuki interrupted curtly.[%p]
It was rare to see Yuki act like this.[%p]
If nothing else, I’d never seen it before.[%p]
It was plain now.[%p]
Yuki didn’t trust Shimoyama. In fact, she considered him an enemy.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No, it’s very strange...”[%p]
Shimoyama paused a moment for effect, and rubbed his chin.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Ci sono altri che affermano di fare sogni molto simili. E non solo uno o due.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Of course, the degree to which they suffer from this problem changes, but we’ve found more than ten in Japan alone.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“They exist in other countries, too. Well, we’ve only got information from the West...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s just a coincidence, isn’t it?”[%p]
Fubuki was incredibly frightened.[%p]
So I spoke in her place.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“You’ve heard of [color index="280AA02D1400"]Puchin[color index="800000"], right?”[%p]
Suddenly Shimoyama turned his gaze toward me, and asked me a question.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Puchin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Soviet... General Secretary, right?”[%p]
I almost said the President of Russia, but managed to stop myself.[%p]
The Unione Sovietica still existed in this linea di universo. Puchin’s title was General Secretary, not President. I’d heard that during my time at Iruma.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Correct. But interestingly enough, Nakase-san referred to him as the President of Russia.”[%p]
Che cosa?[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“I’m sorry. I wasn’t paying attention. And I’m not really what you’d call a good student.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“No, that’s not it. It’s one of the strange things about all the people who have these dreams. They all call him President Puchin.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“And they all call [color index="280AA02D1400"]Golbachev[color index="800000"] and [color index="280AA02E1400"]Leltsin[color index="800000"] presidents, too.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“That’s why the scientists have started calling it ‘President’s Disease.’ Not a terribly clever name, if you ask me.”[%p]
N-No way...[%p]
Is he talking about... Reading Steiner?[%p]
There was a strong chance that people besides me had that power, even if not as acutely.[%p]
I’d never found out for sure, but what Faris had said in the linea di universo Alfa certainly suggested it.[%p]
So it was certainly possible that Shimoyama’s “waking dreams” were actually the effects of Reading Steiner.[%p]
If they were all aware of the linea di universo shift a month ago, just like me...[%p]
If Fubuki had the same memories of the other linea di universo that I had...[%p]
It would make perfect sense that she called Puchin a president.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Golbachev? Leltsin?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“You don’t know them? Didn’t they teach that in world history?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I only took science classes in high school...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I thought everyone knew about them. Do kids today not know who they are? I find it hard to believe you’re all that ignorant.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I’m sure you know about Golbachev and Leltsin, right, Okabe-kun?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-Yeah, I suppose so.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“And [color index="280AA02E1400"]perestrojka[color index="800000"], and the fall of the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Muro di Berlino[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, they were in the textbooks...”[%p]
The second after the words were out of my mouth, an alarm went off in my mind.[%p]
—Something was wrong. There was something strange about what Shimoyama was saying.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
And then I realized.[%p]
The East and West were caught up in the middle of a World War. How could the Muro di Berlino have fallen?[%p]
And could Golbachev really execute perestrojka?[%p]
By the time I realized he’d tricked me, it was too late. My panic appeared on my face.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“...You too, huh?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“And you were deliberately trying to hide it, weren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“So the information was right after all. You know something important.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Listen, Okabe-kun. I want you to tell me.”[%p]
Shimoyama suddenly laughed. It was a bitter laugh, almost eerily so.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Golbachev? Leltsin? Who are these people you all keep talking about?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“We don’t have any data on them, and neither do any of the American intelligence agencies. That data doesn’t exist.”[%p]
Doesn’t exist?[%p]
I looked over at Yuki.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
From the look on her face I could tell that she really had no idea who they were.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Perestrojka? The Fall of the Muro di Berlino? Did these things really happen?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tell me, please.”[%p]
But I couldn’t answer.[%p]
I was thinking of something completely different.[%p]
I suddenly realized why the linea di universo might have changed a month ago on Christmas Eve.[%p]
What if Russia used the time machine that day, in an experiment to change the past?[%p]
The goal of the experiment would’ve been to stop the collapse of the Unione Sovietica.[%p]
And if the result of their changing the past was this linea di universo...![%p]
How foolish...![%p]
A single change to the past and the [color index="280AA02D1400"]effetto farfalla[color index="800000"] makes the entire world so different.[%p]
Did they know how many people had died?[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Have you and your friends really experienced the history of a different world?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I just can’t believe it. It’s just nonsense cooked up by some crazy scientists—”[%p]
He was about to push me further when—[%p]
We heard the sound of an incoming call on a cell phone.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tch...”[%p]
Shimoyama grunted and took his phone out of his pocket.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“This is Shimoyama.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Yeah, we’re on our way to the Bureau.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“What? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Damn it! That’s the problem with these idiots. What country do these politicians think they’re working for?”[%p]
Shimoyama’s finger slammed down on the “end call” button so hard I thought the phone would break. There was a look of rage on his face.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“We’re changing our destination. Head to [color index="280AA02D1400"]Kadena Base[color index="800000"]. Gate 2.”[%p]
His words were filled with irritation as he spoke to the driver.[%p]
Changing destinations?[%p]
Who was he just talking to?[%p]
As I sat there confused, Shimoyama started to call someone else.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“This is Shimoyama. We’re changing our destination. We’ll meet at Gate 2 at Kadena Base.”[%p]
That was all he said before he hung up.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um... what’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“The situation’s changed. Okabe-kun is heading to a US military base.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“From there, he might get to take a fun trip on a US Air Force plane to America.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cos—?!”[%p]
America?![%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I’ll ask them to make sure you get first-class accommodations, but don’t get your hopes up. They don’t listen to us any more than you’d listen to a yapping pet dog.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why America?!”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“I don’t know if it’s the [color index="280AA02D1400"]CIA[color index="800000"] or the [color index="280AA02E1400"]NSC[color index="800000"], but someone wants us to hand you over.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But why?!”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Ask them yourself.”[%p]
And then he turned back toward the front and fell silent, refusing to answer any of my questions.[%p]
The car went down the road for a while, until we got off at an exit that read “South Okinawa.”[%p]
We stopped in front of the gate.[%p]
Several US soldiers had evidently been waiting for my arrival.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Once we hand you over to the Americans, we’re not going to get any accurate information from them.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“So this is my last chance.”[%p]
Shimoyama turned around from the front passenger seat and looked straight at me.[%p]
His eyes were desperate, and begging.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Tell me. What are we supposed to do from now on?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Please.”[%p]
I remembered all the soldiers in Tokyo who’d fought so desperately to protect me.[%p]
Were they fighting to help someone else in Tokyo right now? Or were they already...?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Non lo so.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Okabe-kun...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I really don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you think I can do something about this war all by myself?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Knowing that Golbachev and Leltsin were presidents of Russia, or that they brought a dramatic end to the Cold War... that doesn’t actually help anything.”[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“...”[%p]
I could hear the sound of another car getting closer.[%p]
Shimoyama sighed and opened the passenger side door.[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Get out.”[%p]
I exited the car as I was told.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Mayuri got out of the van behind us and ran over to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
My childhood friend flung herself into my arms, and I held her tight.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I finally... get to see you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m so glad you’re safe...”[%p]
I could feel her warmth.[%p]
Mayuri era qui.[%p]
I’d never gone almost a whole month without seeing her before.[%p]
And this was wartime. I couldn’t easily contact her like I could in the old linea di universo.[%p]
So I’d been so worried about whether or not Mayuri was ok.[%p]
It was no exaggeration to say that I’d survived this far just to make sure.[%p]
I’d erased the entire linea di universo Alfa to save her.[%p]
No matter what happened, I wanted her to be safe.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... you’re hurting me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, scusa.”[%p]
I’d held her too closely.[%p]
I took a step back.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii believed, you know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii believed she’d get to see Okarin again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hooray! You’re safe, nya!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san!”[%p]
I heard two more voices I recognized.[%p]
Faris and Luka, and behind them I saw Kaede.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m glad you’re all safe...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san, io... io...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
I felt myself getting choked up, too, when I saw Lukako cry.[%p]
I exchanged greetings with Kaede, too. Fubuki had grabbed on to her like a little kid. She was still pale and trembling.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris... I guess you’re not wearing your maid outfit for once.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s been a long time since anybody’s called me Faris, nya.”[%p]
Faris spoke sadly. Then she put her hand around my neck and held me close. Her little pink lips got close to my ear, as if she was about to kiss me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-Hey...”[%p]
Cosa sta succedendo?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hahaha, don’t be so embarrassed, nyan.”[%p]
She laughed mischievously. Then Faris, no, Akiha Rumiho, whispered into my ear while pretending to kiss me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Be careful. Don’t trust the Ministero della Difesa or the Americans.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Adults are all liars. None of them tell the truth.”[%p]
That’s right. Faris had a special talent.[%p]
[color index="280AA02D1400"]Cheshire[color index="800000"] Break.[%p]
She was incredibly good at looking into someone’s heart and seeing what they were thinking.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. I just figured that out.”[%p]
One of them just tricked me.[%p]
Faris looked surprised and took a step back.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That’s sad, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sì.”[%p]
And then I heard the sound of another engine.[%p]
This time it was coming from beyond the gate, and inside the base.[%p]
It belonged to a black luxury car with an E on the license plate. Behind it was a minibus.[%p]
The two of them stopped in front of the gate.[%p]
It was time for my reunion to end.[%p]
[name]Personale militare statunitense[line]“Welcome!”[%p]
An American soldier as tall as a basketball player got out of the car.[%p]
[name]Personale militare statunitense[line]“Welcome, everyone. My name is Hammond.”[%p]
His Japanese was good, but not great.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“Everyone except Mister Okabe, please get on the bus.”[%p]
He was smiling, but I could tell he wasn’t going to allow any arguments.[%p]
And the other American soldiers were still carrying their rifles, as they stood guard without smiles.[%p]
Shimoyama and the other Japanese soldiers were watching us from a distance. They didn’t try to stop us. They were just looking downward.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? Everyone but Okarin? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“There’s no need to be scared. We’re just going to talk to you a little, and then we’ll send you right to the Ufficio della difesa di Okinawa! Come along.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s fine. Don’t worry.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Però...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yuki-san, take care of Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Ok.”[%p]
Yuki nodded and put her arm around Mayuri’s shoulder as she led her to the bus. Everyone else followed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tell my parents I said hi.”[%p]
Once everyone but me was on, the minibus left immediately.[%p]
The area in front of the gate fell silent.[%p]
It was hard to believe this existed in the same world as all the places I’d crossed on my escape through Japan’s main island.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“All right, Mister Okabe. Come this way.”[%p]
He told me to get in the back seat of the black luxury car.[%p]
What would happen to me once I got inside?[%p]
I tried to think about it, but realized there was nothing I could do. I was just about to get into the car when—[%p]
[name]Shimoyama[line]“Okabe-kun, run! If you go to America you won’t come back alive—”[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Shimoyama’s scream was cut off by the sound of gunfire.[%p]
In the corner of my eye I saw the American soldiers firing without hesitation.[%p]
Non può essere...[%p]
I tried to turn around, when—[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“Get inside.”[%p]
A large hand blocked my vision as Hammond held me down.[%p]
I couldn’t hear Shimoyama’s voice anymore.[%p]
Through the gaps between his fingers I could see that nothing was moving.[%p]
And I knew exactly what that meant.[%p]
I was shoved into the car before I had time to think about it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is—”[%p]
I tried to open my mouth, but Hammond looked into my eyes and shook his head.[%p]
I wasn’t supposed to talk, then.[%p]
Hammond sat next to me, then closed the door. The car started to move.[%p]
Soon, we turned down a different road than the one the minibus was taking.[%p]
America, huh?[%p]
I’d never been there before.[%p]
What were they going to do to me there?[%p]
Use me as a guinea pig? Cut open my head and dissect my brain?[%p]
I probably wasn’t going to be able to do any tourist things.[%p]
I felt like screaming, but tried my best to stay calm.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“There’s someone I want you to meet.”[%p]
Hammond suddenly spoke. Then he handed me something.[%p]
I took it before I even looked at what it was. When I checked, it was a normal smartphone.[%p]
[name]Hammond[line]“It’s not locked. Just hit that button.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
Confused, I pressed the button as I was told.[%p]
And then something appeared on the screen—[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“[Kurisu]...!”[%p]
It was the Amadeus Makise Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why does the US military have Amadeus?”[%p]
I was about to ask Hammond when...[%p]
For the first time in about a month, that feeling came back.[%p]
