[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah...!”[%p]
The world twisted and warped.[%p]
I felt horribly dizzy.[%p]
Sometimes my vision would blur for no reason.[%p]
But this was nothing like that.[%p]
It was like my mind itself was being wrung apart.[%p]
Like the world itself was changing.[%p]
Déjà vu.[%p]
I knew this feeling.[%p]
Era—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahh... Hahh...”[%p]
At last, the color came back to my vision.[%p]
All the shouts of the pedestrians and the noise of the passing cars came flooding in at once.[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Um, Okarin-san? Are you ok? You’re sweating bullets.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Do you not feel well?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, no...”[%p]
Fubuki and Kaede...[%p]
The two of them were still in front of me. They looked worried.[%p]
Had I just gotten dizzy for a moment?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine, really. Thanks for asking.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Ok, we’ll be going.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“I’m looking forward to the party.”[%p]
They said their goodbyes and walked toward the station.[%p]
I watched them go, only halfway paying attention.[%p]
Cos’è stato?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
None of the passersby noticed me standing there.[%p]
They were all experiencing time sequentially, as one connected moment after another.[%p]
But I knew what I just saw.[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
I... I was the one person who understood.[%p]
That feeling was Reading Steiner.[%p]
Which meant... that the linea di universo had changed?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
I shook my head and tried to get the idea out of my mind.[%p]
Non era possibile.[%p]
The linea di universo could only change if someone had altered the past.[%p]
I’d only ever seen linea di universo changes after I’d sent [color index="280AA02E1400"]le D-Mail[color index="800000"] with the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio)[color index="800000"].[%p]
But I’d destroyed the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio), so that could never happen again.[%p]
I’d sacrificed Kurisu for it.[%p]
But then who did this? And how?[%p]
What if someone had made a device identical to the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio)?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Mayuri...[%p]
I need to see if Mayuri is safe![%p]
I’ll call her right now.[%p]
If the linea di universo change meant something terrible had happened to Mayuri again...[%p]
Just imagining it made me shiver.[%p]
That couldn’t happen.[%p]
It wouldn’t.[%p]
That’s what I wanted to believe, but I couldn’t help but remember all the times I’d seen her die in the linea di universo Alfa.[%p]
For now, I needed to get in touch with her as soon as possible.[%p]
I wanted to hear her voice.[%p]
Um... what do I do...?[%p]
I realized I was panicking.[%p]
Calmati.[%p]
Relax.[%p]
I picked her name off the contacts list on my phone and dialed.[%p]
I could hear the call sound in my ear.[%p]
But there was no sign of her picking up.[%p]
Seven seconds, eight, nine...[%p]
Each second made the fear worse. I felt cold sweat drip down my back.[%p]
Twelve seconds. Thirteen seconds. Fourteen seconds.[%p]
I kept calling and praying anyway.[%p]
Eventually, after a minute of ringing, the electronic sound suddenly cut off.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪! It’s Mayushii!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Is that you, Mayuri? It’s really you, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O-Okarin? What’s wrong?”[%p]
The relaxed, easy-going voice I heard most definitely belonged to Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was so worried. I kept calling and you didn’t pick up...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, sorry. My phone was in my bag.”[%p]
It was nothing.[%p]
Nothing had happened at all.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you need something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No, don’t worry about it. I was just feeling nervous.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nervous?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you now? Are you with someone?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m going to work.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Until when?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“About 8 PM...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. Got it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Will you come to see me, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’m busy today. I can’t.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m going to the lab after I get off work.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok... If I can go, we’ll meet up there, and I’ll walk you home.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? That’s rare. Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Bye. Work hard, ok?”[%p]
I hung up.[%p]
Mayuri was safe.[%p]
Which meant that the linea di universo change probably had nothing to do with her. Not that I could let my guard down...[%p]
Or maybe that was just a daydream, and there was no linea di universo change at all.[%p]
It seemed awfully realistic for that to be the case, though.[%p]
Just to be safe, I turned on my phone again.[%p]
The icon was still there, in the same place it had been the last several times I’d used it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I felt a little hesitation.[%p]
Especially after what happened.[%p]
Could I really contact her after that?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
But I decided that it was important to see what was going on first, so I tapped the icon.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What? Did you forget to say something?”[%p]
[Kurisu]’s voice was the same as ever.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You’re not mad?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Mad? Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because I just hung up on you. So...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You already apologized for that just now. I’m not the kind of person to keep getting mad after I’ve forgiven someone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just now?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“That’s right. You called back, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Called back? I did?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“It was only seven minutes and 43 seconds ago. Did you forget?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I apologized? To you?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...Stai bene?”[%p]
[Kurisu] was evidently telling the truth.[%p]
She didn’t look like she was lying, at least.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What happened? Your expression’s totally different than it was a moment ago.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No, I’m fine.”[%p]
Non me lo ricordo.[%p]
I remembered turning off the phone, but I didn’t remember anything about calling her—the Amadeus [Kurisu]—back after that.[%p]
The old me would’ve insisted that I was right and that she was mistaken.[%p]
But now... I wasn’t sure.[%p]
After all the different pasts I’d experienced, and all the sadness and pain I’d gone through, even six months later, I was still exhausted.[%p]
What had really happened, and what hadn’t?[%p]
What was right and what was wrong? I wasn’t sure anymore.[%p]
I just didn’t want to think about it anymore.[%p]
The past, the future, the fate of the world...[%p]
I wanted nothing to do with any of it.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You’re not looking so good. Shouldn’t you call one of your friends, or go rest somewhere?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...Okabe?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, [Kurisu]. Can I ask you something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you know what I was about to do after I called you just now?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You’re going to meet with Dr. Leskinen and Maho-senpai, right?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You’re supposed to talk about me.”[%p]
Evidently my memories matched hers in that regard.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ho capito.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Should I tell Maho-senpai about you in advance?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine, really. Sorry to worry you.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Don’t push yourself too hard. I don’t want to be the last person you ever talk to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I chuckled bitterly and ended the conversation.[%p]
I called Daru too, just in case, and evidently I really was on my way to see the professor and Maho.[%p]
He also told me that almost all of the events of the last few days matched my memory of them.[%p]
Which meant that even if the linea di universo had changed, nothing had changed nearby, where I could’ve seen it.[%p]
There was no problem. Or at least, there shouldn’t have been a problem.[%p]
It was possible that that moment of dizziness was just the result of mental illness.[%p]
Experiencing those same sensations brought up my past trauma, and caused my memories to get confused. Maybe that was it.[%p]
The Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio) didn’t exist.[%p]
So there was no way the past could have changed.[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
That was all.[%p]
I kept telling myself this as I went to see the professor.[%p]
I met with the professor and Maho in a hotel room.[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“So then, Lintahlo, you say that your communication with Amadeus is going well so far?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yes. The conversations are always smooth and coherent.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“While I’m at it, what about the distance between you and [Kurisu]?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Distance... what do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Do you find yourself getting closer to her as you talk more?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, a bit more than when we first started talking.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A bit? You sure you don’t mean a lot?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m talking to her too, so I can tell.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“At first she was so mad when she said you ignored eight of her calls.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But now you’re quite friendly with each other. That means you’ve gotten that much closer, right?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“I see! Wonderful!”[%p]
Leskinen seemed overjoyed by Maho’s words.[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“I’ve got great hopes for this. It’s possible she’ll view you as a friend, or perhaps a love interest.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A love interest?!”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“You don’t need to shout, do you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But... she’s an AI, right?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“It’s precisely because she’s an AI that I’m interested.”[%p]
What did he mean?[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“She has emotions, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes, but they’re simply running on top of a program...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“But isn’t that the same as the human brain?”[%p]
He was right. The brain ran on electrical signals, so you could say it had the same structure.[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“The question of whether machines have emotions was settled a long time ago. They do.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“And anyway, Amadeus was designed to mimic the human brain.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“If the structure is the same, and so is the process, shouldn’t that lead to identical results?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Which means it’s quite possible she could fall in love. In fact, I hope she does.”[%p]
Amadeus... falling in love.[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Oops, is this an upsetting topic for Maho?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t you start acting like [Kurisu] too, professor.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Hahaha. It was a joke. A joke.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Maho’s scary when she gets mad, so be careful.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes, I’m well aware.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You know I can hear you, right?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Oh! I forgot that I need to call Judy. Lintahlo, I’ll be right back.”[%p]
The professor quickly left the room.[%p]
...He ran away, didn’t he?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Christ. [Kurisu] first, and now the professor. Why do they have to make everything about love?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve got that right.”[%p]
Of course, that was always the type of girl she was.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, right, Okabe-san. I had a question.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Do you know any words that she... that Kurisu really liked?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Words?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Or numbers or something. Anything that could be a key?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What, are you trying to break a password she set?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s exactly right. I’m impressed.”[%p]
I was right...?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that her work computer or something?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No, her personal laptop. It was at her home.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why do you have something like that?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Her mom gave it to me, so I’d have something to remember her by.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m trying to figure out what’s on it, so I’m looking for a way to crack the password. I thought you might know something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If it’s got a password, that means she didn’t want anyone seeing it, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Questo è vero, ma...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If I want to make her... the Amadeus [Kurisu]...close to the real one, it would be better to have that data, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Of course, I’ll do my best not to do anything that violates her privacy.”[%p]
I knew what she was trying to say.[%p]
She might have had some kind of diary on her computer, which described what she’d been doing during her time here.[%p]
Però...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, I can’t think of anything.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Nothing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. And even if I did know, I don’t think I’d tell you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Because there’s something you don’t want anyone finding out?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Computers hold a person’s most private secrets these days.”[%p]
Daru talked about that all the time.[%p]
He was always wondering if there was a way to automatically wipe a computer’s hard drive if you died in an accident.[%p]
Of course, what Daru didn’t want anyone to see was probably very different than what was on Kurisu’s computer. Beyond that, it was the same idea.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Capisco...”[%p]
She seemed really interested in the contents of the hard drive, but she didn’t say anything else.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, I’ll be going...”[%p]
I was a little worried about Mayuri, too.[%p]
I got up and went to leave.[%p]
And then I saw a small ornament that was decorating the door.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come to think of it, it’s almost Christmas...”[%p]
I remembered how excited Mayuri was.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you staying here for Christmas, Hiyajo-san?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah. I’ve still got stuff to do here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you spending it with anyone...?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Cosa?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I mean... outside of Japan, don’t people usually have Christmas parties with their friends?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sorry, but I don’t have any plans like that.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And Americans and Europeans don’t have Christmas parties.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They don’t?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Christmas is a holy day to them, right? So they normally spend it with their families. They do have big New Year’s parties, though.”[%p]
I thought I’d heard something about that on TV or somewhere.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Well, I don’t have any family here, so I’ll be alone regardless.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But that doesn’t mean I’m lonely. Don’t get the wrong idea, ok?”[%p]
Or so she said, but being all alone on Christmas in a bustling town was probably pretty lonely.[%p]
Of course, she’d probably get mad if I told her that, so I didn’t.[%p]
