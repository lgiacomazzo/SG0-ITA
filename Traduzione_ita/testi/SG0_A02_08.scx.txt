[name]Faris[line]“Oh, there mew are, Okarin.”[%p]
I came straight up to the lab, where most of the people who were here yesterday had gathered.[%p]
Maho was busy with a problem Amadeus was having, and she was the only one who couldn’t come.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You guys all ok getting together like this, after what just happened?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“What just happened is what we’re here to talk about.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“And Hashida-san said it would be safer to meet in the same place instead of moving.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“They’re not dumb enough to attack when we’ve got our guard up. Especially not in the middle of the day.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s safer to have everyone together than split up.”[%p]
Maybe they were right.[%p]
Whoever they were, it was hard to imagine them starting something in Akihabara, Japan in the middle of the day.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I’m just glad you’re all safe.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Thank you for coming, Yuki-san.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“No, I was really worried after hearing about what happened last night.”[%p]
Yuki wasn’t here during the attack, but she’d come to see how we were doing.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I still can’t believe something that scary could happen in Japan, though.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Even outside of Japan, it’s not something you’d see every day.”[%p]
Era vero.[%p]
Nobody who lived a normal life would ever see it.[%p]
That’s what “normal” meant.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um, I hate to be going when you just got here, but I have work after this...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sure, don’t worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I’m happy to see you’re all safe. But you still can’t let your guard down, so be caref—kyah!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Watch out!”[%p]
Yuki almost slipped as she walked past me. I grabbed her arm to hold her up.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Ow...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh... sorry...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“No, I tripped and hurt my arm there when I was at the station yesterday.”[%p]
She rubbed the arm I’d grabbed, embarrassed.[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Another time when I trip on nothing at all... I hate being so clumsy.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Take care, Yuki-san.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Thanks. Ok everybody, see you.”[%p]
The door closed and I could hear her footsteps trail off into the distance.[%p]
Two days of work in a row, right after New Year’s, huh?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“È successo qualcosa, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Non è niente...”[%p]
The way she hurt her arm—[%p]
It was the left arm, the same place the woman in the motorcycle suit had gotten hit.[%p]
But there was no way...[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“All right, Okarin-san. Can you tell us what happened yesterday?”[%p]
Fubuki was a little more chipper than Mayuri and Luka.[%p]
She and Kaede had gone shopping, and so they’d missed the attack. That was probably why. They were lucky not to have encountered any of the escaping attackers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok, so first thing...”[%p]
Daru and I had spent hours discussing how much to tell them.[%p]
After all that, I couldn’t just play it off like nothing had happened.[%p]
The only ones here who knew about the time machine were Daru, Faris, and Mayuri.[%p]
Was it ok to tell Luka, Fubuki, and Kaede?[%p]
And then Maho...[%p]
If she knew that Kurisu had completed a time machine theory, she’d definitely be interested.[%p]
In the end, the conclusion I’d come up with was—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So that’s what happened.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“In other words, you think Kagari-san may have been involved in some sort of crime when she had amnesia?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s my guess.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Then why don’t we go to the police?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because, um... She’s really scared of the police. It’s possible that they could be involved in it, too.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Hmm... This all just doesn’t feel right.”[%p]
Of course it doesn’t.[%p]
I was basically telling them that I didn’t know anything.[%p]
But even if I was hiding a lot of the truth, the fact remained that it was mostly correct.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So what we learned last night was that they’re after Kagari-san, and unlikely to hurt us, right?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Why do you think so?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“They would’ve been able to take one of us as a hostage in that situation, if they had wanted to.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Since they didn’t, that means that they want to try and keep this quiet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru and I reached the same conclusion.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So that means as long as we don’t cause a fuss, we’re fine.”[%p]
That was a lie.[%p]
Just like Suzuha had said earlier, there was a good chance they might come after us because we’d seen their faces.[%p]
But it wasn’t smart to say that and worry everyone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So I don’t think it’s a good idea for Nakase-san and Kurushima-san to come around here for a while.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“But what will you do about Kagari-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve taken precautions. I gave her a bodyguard.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A bodyguard?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Two, actually. The two who drove them away last night.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san and the owner, right?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Oh, that guy with the huge muscles!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“But that means she’s going to have to live in fear that she’ll be attacked again...”[%p]
That was right. Just playing defense wouldn’t solve anything.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m planning on hiring a detective to see if I can find out who’s after Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Once I have more information, I may go to the police.”[%p]
Of course, more than half of that was lies again.[%p]
If I went to the police or a detective, they wouldn’t believe me about Kagari being a time traveler.[%p]
But what was important now was calming everyone down. From there, I’d have to solve things myself.[%p]
Ad essere onesti, I was sick of living in the middle of a teoria complottista.[%p]
But it was the only way I could get my everyday life back.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...I think, nya. Hey, Okarin? Are you listening, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Oh, I’m sorry. What were we talking about?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I told Kuroki about what happened yesterday, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If anything weird goes on in Akihabara, he’s sure to let us know right away, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Capisco...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Also, I’ve asked the neighborhood watch to step up their patrols, nya. Whoever they were, that will keep them away for a while, I think, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks, Faris. That’s a huge help.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No problem, nya.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, is there anything I can do?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kagari-san’s in trouble and there’s nothing I can do... And I can’t help you either, Okabe-san. It’s just...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wants to do something for Kagari-san, too.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“But is there anything we can do?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Beh...”[%p]
Tutti erano silenziosi.[%p]
Even after all that had happened to them, they still wanted to help.[%p]
But I couldn’t let them be in danger.[%p]
And then I remembered what Tennouji had said.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“K6205...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Che cos’è?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Supposedly, it’s something the attackers yesterday were saying. But I have no idea what it’s supposed to mean...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hold on, I’ll lo [color index="280AA02D1400"]cerco su goggle[color index="800000"].”[%p]
Daru opened a browser and quickly typed it in.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm... I’m only seeing product IDs and stuff.”[%p]
Tennouji said they might be military.[%p]
So it might be a military code.[%p]
Which meant there was nothing we could do.[%p]
I was hoping there might be some clue, but...[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Köchel...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm? Kurushima-san, what did you say?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“No, I was just thinking that K might mean a Köchel number. But that doesn’t make any sense, does it?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“What’s a Köchel number?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“It’s a numbering system for Mozart’s songs. After he died, a man named Köchel ordered his songs chronologically and gave them all numbers.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“But I don’t think even Mozart wrote 6000 songs, and I don’t think it’s got anything to do with this...”[%p]
Mozart...[%p]
Wolfgang A. Mozart.[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Sorry for bringing up something so weird.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, how high up do those Köchel numbers go?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It says the last one is 626, a song named Requiem.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“That’s the song Mozart was writing just before he died, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know a lot about it, Kaede-san.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“You know, I play the piano...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then what’s K620?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“620... 620... Oh, here it is. It’s a song named [color index="280AA02D1400"]Il Flauto Magico[color index="800000"].”[%p]
I’d heard the name before, at least.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me see.”[%p]
I looked over Daru’s shoulder at the screen.[%p]
He clicked on the heading for Il Flauto Magico on Mozart’s wiki page.[%p]
Il Flauto Magico.[%p]
K620.[%p]
Written in 1791.[%p]
Mozart’s last completed opera.[%p]
It was famous for including numerous examples of dottrina e simboli [color index="280AA02D1400"]massonici[color index="800000"]...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So K6205 is, what, the fifth song in the opera?”[%p]
The fifth song was a quintet called “Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!”[%p]
“Papageno, the bird-catcher, has a padlock placed over his lips, and this is his song begging someone to open the lock.”[%p]
Mozart.[%p]
Amadeus.[%p]
Massoneria.[%p]
A padlock on his lips?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Got anything?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... No, but...”[%p]
Why did this all feel so creepy?[%p]
And didn’t I just talk to somebody about Mozart?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Non guardare la password.”[%p]
Maho.[%p]
Maho had used Salieri, Mozart’s rival, as her ID to access Amadeus.[%p]
On its own, that didn’t mean anything, but...[%p]
Come to think of it, Maho said she lost access to Amadeus just before the attack last night, didn’t she?[%p]
Did she ever find out what caused it?[%p]
I’d have to call her, or contact her via RINE.[%p]
Which would be faster?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me make a quick call.”[%p]
I pulled her number out of my contacts and called her.[%p]
I made it through after a few calls.[%p]
I hoped she’d pick up soon.[%p]
Uwah![%p]
I suddenly got a message that almost made me leap out of my chair.[%p]
I looked at my screen and saw it was from Maho.[%p]
Did she see my message and call me?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What? Was there something else?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, there was something I wanted to ask you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Make it quick.”[%p]
Her irritation was plain from her voice. Which meant that she hadn’t solved whatever the problem with Amadeus was.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How are things with Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Not good.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The system’s down?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No. I can’t access it.”[%p]
Il che significa—[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Someone may have taken over the Amadeus system.”[%p]
Taken over?[%p]
Amadeus?[%p]
Ma perché?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sorry, but that’s all I’ve got. Once I know something, I’ll call you.”[%p]
She hung up on me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Was that Maho-tan? What did she say?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She said it looks like somebody’s taken over Amadeus.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Taken it over, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought there might be some connection over this Mozart thing, but...”[%p]
I couldn’t say anything yet.[%p]
Fragments of these strange incidents were scattered all around me.[%p]
È così che mi sentivo.[%p]
If I could pick up all the pieces and connect them, would I find the answer?[%p]
For example—[%p]
Amane Yuki’s injured left arm.[%p]
Che cosa voleva dire?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
Just as I was about to put my phone back in my pocket, it rang again.[%p]
At first I thought that Maho might have forgotten to tell me something, but when I saw the screen, I gasped.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ma cosa?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Who’s calling?”[%p]
I stared at the screen, unable to answer.[%p]
The phone kept ringing.[%p]
What was the meaning of this?[%p]
Why would Amadeus, who’d been taken over, be calling me?[%p]
Was this some kind of trap?[%p]
Cosa dovrei fare?[%p]
Answer it?[%p]
Oppure...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pronto?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...Help me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“[Kurisu]?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Aiutami, Okabe...”[%p]
In that instant—[%p]
All’improvviso ho avuto un fortissimo capogiro, e tutto intorno a me è diventato nero.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I felt like I was floating up from the bottom of a black pit.[%p]
My mind slowly began to clear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where am I?”[%p]
I slowly looked around the room.[%p]
There was no way I could mistake it.[%p]
This was the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici.[%p]
The place I’d been just a moment ago.[%p]
There was nothing unusual about it.[%p]
Except for the fact that everyone was missing.[%p]
They’d been there just a moment ago, but now they were all gone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I looked at the clock.[%p]
It had been just about 3 PM when I’d finished my call with Maho.[%p]
Only a few minutes had passed.[%p]
Even if I’d passed out, it was impossible to imagine all of them leaving me here.[%p]
Il che significava...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Non può essere...”[%p]
I took a slow walk around the room.[%p]
There were other strange things.[%p]
Daru’s PC, for example.[%p]
There was a thin layer of dust on the keyboard.[%p]
As if no one had used it for a while.[%p]
And then the corner of the room.[%p]
Normally, that was where Mayuri put her bags.[%p]
The paper bags where she always put the cosplay outfits she was working on.[%p]
I’d seen them there just a moment ago, but now they were gone.[%p]
Could this be...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The linea di universo changed again...”[%p]
Ma perché?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ora che ci penso...”[%p]
[Kurisu]’s words from before.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Aiutami, Okabe...”[%p]
Why would [Kurisu] say something like that?[%p]
Did it have something to do with the linea di universo shift?[%p]
I took the phone out of my pocket and went to start the Amadeus app—and then stopped.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s gone...”[%p]
The Amadeus icon was gone from my phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](What’s going on here?)[%p]
My mind raced to try and come up with an explanation.[%p]
But of course, I came up with nothing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](Calm down... Just find out what’s going on here.)[%p]
I needed to calmly find out what this world was like.[%p]
I was about to walk toward the door to find out, when—[%p]
The back of the room.[%p]
I heard a sound from the back of the area di sviluppo, which no one ever used anymore.[%p]
C’era qualcuno.[%p]
Chi?[%p]
Daru?[%p]
Mayuri?[%p]
I slowly approached.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
I almost couldn’t breathe.[%p]
I never forgot.[%p]
I’d never forgotten her.[%p]
The girl standing there—[%p]
—was Makise Kurisu.[%p]
I hesitated a moment, and the call from Amadeus ended. My phone fell silent.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s going on—”[%p]
And right after that—[%p]
All’improvviso ho avuto un fortissimo capogiro, e tutto intorno a me è diventato nero.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? What’s going on?!”[%p]
