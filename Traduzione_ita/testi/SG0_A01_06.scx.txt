[name]Studente[line]“Hey, Okabe. You got class after this?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nope, I’m done for the day.”[%p]
[name]Studente[line]“Then you want to go get some food somewhere?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You just want curry again, don’t you? [color index="280AA02D1400"]Kitchen Toukai[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Studente[line]“I got a bit of an extra bonus yesterday, so maybe I’ll splurge and go to [color index="280AA02D1400"]Mondi[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll pass. I’m a little tight this month.”[%p]
[name]Studente[line]“Ok. Maybe next time, then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sure.”[%p]
I was talking with my friends after class.[%p]
I’d really started to get used to this.[%p]
Before the summer, I’d felt really out of place at school, but now, it didn’t seem so bad.[%p]
Back then, I thought I was special.[%p]
But now I knew better.[%p]
As long as you make the effort to fit in, you can find a place to belong.[%p]
People can change.[%p]
No, they change whether they want to or not.[%p]
It was too late now, but I’d learned something about myself.[%p]
It really was too late...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, time to go home... huh?”[%p]
As I headed for the exit, I realized that I recognized one of the people passing through my field of vision.[%p]
Quella persona era...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Dr. Leskinen?”[%p]
My college went out of its way to attract exchange students, so it wasn’t unusual to see foreigners.[%p]
But still...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...He’s gone.”[%p]
I hurried after him, but the person I just saw was already gone.[%p]
Was I just mistaken?[%p]
Come to think of it, the professor being here wouldn’t be strange.[%p]
He might have come to meet with my advisor, Izaki.[%p]
Izaki had wanted to get to know him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](Next time I see him, I’ll ask...)[%p]
I glanced in the direction he’d gone, and then left the school for Akihabara.[%p]
When I came out of the turnstile, Radi-Kan was right in front of me, like always.[%p]
The time machine that Suzuha had used to come here was probably still on the roof.[%p]
Even if people didn’t go up there often, it was still amazing that no one had found it after so long.[%p]
Of course, that was all thanks to Faris.[%p]
She’d rented out the roof of the building and sealed it off.[%p]
Of course, I hadn’t come here to look at the time machine.[%p]
I’d gotten messages from Lukako and Faris after I’d left the lab last night.[%p]
Both of them had asked, and neither of them were able to get any useful information for me.[%p]
It made sense, when I thought about it.[%p]
If there was a missing persons report, somebody might remember the police doing something, but there wasn’t.[%p]
But Faris had said something interesting.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But I did hear about a ghost with twin tails, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A ghost with twin tails?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyat’s right. Supposedly it appears every few years and asks people if they’ve seen a little girl, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No matter how many years pass its appearance doesn’t change, so people call it the ghost with twin tails, nya.”[%p]
That was definitely Suzuha.[%p]
What would she do if she knew people thought she was a ghost?[%p]
I held back a laugh as I tried to imagine it, and then headed for Radi-Kan.[%p]
My goal, of course, was to find information on Kagari.[%p]
This was where she’d vanished.[%p]
Which meant this was where I was most likely to find clues.[%p]
I went around to each store inside Radi-Kan and asked, but didn’t learn anything.[%p]
Of course, Suzuha would’ve done the same thing, so I didn’t expect much.[%p]
But that didn’t mean I could just stop.[%p]
The parts shops...[%p]
The commercial facilities...[%p]
Even the back alleys.[%p]
Even after all that, I went all around Akihabara asking people about Kagari.[%p]
But I didn’t learn anything useful.[%p]
Some people told me the same story, about the ghost in twin tails, but no one knew anything about Kagari.[%p]
If a little girl was kidnapped, or got into an accident, somebody might witness that.[%p]
But going missing was a different thing.[%p]
If Shiina Kagari vanished of her own free will, all anyone would see was a ten-year-old girl walking down the street.[%p]
Nobody would remember that ten years later.[%p]
I tried to think again if there was a better way.[%p]
If the police and government weren’t of any use, that left... someone connected to the underworld.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The underworld, huh?”[%p]
As soon as I said it aloud, I drove the idea from my mind.[%p]
How stupid.[%p]
That’s something the old me would’ve thought of.[%p]
I’d given that stuff up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ora che ci penso...”[%p]
I’d run all over Akihabara looking for something once before.[%p]
I wasn’t looking for a person then, but a thing.[%p]
The IBN 5100.[%p]
Six months ago in the linea di universo Alfa, I’d gone looking for the same thing that Suzuha had searched for in the past.[%p]
Back then... That’s right. Kurisu was with me.[%p]
When Kurisu and I had learned that there was an IBN 5100 in Lukako’s storeroom, we’d worked together to carry the heavy thing.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t walk forward. Then I have to walk backward. Let’s walk sideways.”[%p]
Thinking back, all she’d ever done was complain.[%p]
She was strong-willed, bratty, and hated to lose, but she was still so lonely...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Once again, I’d taken my phone out of my pocket without realizing it.[%p]
Amadeus...[%p]
Since I hadn’t picked up any of her calls yesterday, she hadn’t called at all today.[%p]
I stared at the Amadeus icon for a moment,[%p]
and then put my phone back in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
When I got back to the lab, I saw that Daru was completely exhausted.[%p]
Non c’era nemmeno bisogno di chiederlo.[%p]
It was obvious he hadn’t found a single clue.[%p]
Suzuha had been doing this for over half a year, so her face didn’t betray her emotions anymore.[%p]
Daru didn’t even bother asking me how it went.[%p]
He could probably tell from the look on my face.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“When you stop to think about it, Suzuha’s been working pretty hard at this. We amateurs aren’t exactly going to find something new on our own.”[%p]
Daru said what I’d been thinking, but trying not to say.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thanks for helping. You don’t need to waste any more time on this. I’ll keep looking on my own.”[%p]
Suzuha evidently had no intention of giving up.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No, wait a second, Suzuha. What I’m trying to say is—”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I can’t let you guys keep working so hard at this. What happened with Kagari is my responsibility.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t be silly. If the kid’s responsible, the parent’s responsible, [color index="280AA02D1400"]noob[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Papà...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, how was that? I think I was a pretty good daddy there. If you want to hug me and tell me how much you love your daddy, go right ahead!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ha...”[%p]
Watching these two always gave me a strange feeling.[%p]
For a while after they first met, they were complete strangers.[%p]
And now they were father and child.[%p]
And age-wise, they were exactly the same.[%p]
Maybe I could understand how Suzuha was feeling, but I had no idea what Daru was going through.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, what I’m trying to say here is, just searching around randomly isn’t going to get you anywhere.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what are we supposed to do?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You ask someone who knows this stuff. The best way to handle this is to go to a specialist.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A specialist?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The way to do this is to talk to someone who knows the underworld, duh.”[%p]
I realized he’d come up with the same idea I had. My head hurt.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Do you know someone like that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Tch, tch, tch. Don’t underestimate your daddy. He may be an otaku, but he’s well-known in certain circles.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well-known for being a tub of lard.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t make fun of me, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And anyway, are you serious? Do you really know someone with underworld connections?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll see who I can find.”[%p]
Before Suzuha or I could respond, he took out his phone and started typing a message to someone.[%p]
Was he serious?[%p]
And was text messaging the preferred way to get in touch with the criminal underworld?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What do you think, Uncle?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If someone like that really exists, it can’t hurt to ask them.”[%p]
In fairness, being a hacker was a pretty underworld sort of occupation, too.[%p]
If I knew someone like him, it was quite possible that the person he said he knew really existed.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ok, sent. Now we just wait for a response...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? It’s back already?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. Says she’s on her way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’s pretty fast, isn’t she?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Better than slow, isn’t it?”[%p]
Ha ragione.[%p]
Daru was sending another message.[%p]
He was probably telling her where we were.[%p]
Now all we had to do was wait for her arrival.[%p]
And then the phone rang.[%p]
Not Daru’s phone. My phone.[%p]
Was it [Kurisu] again?[%p]
I picked it up, and it was Lukako.[%p]
That was rare. When he wanted to talk to me, he always went through Mayuri, or sent a message via text or RINE.[%p]
Or... Wait, could Daru’s “underworld contact” be Lukako?[%p]
Maybe there was a top-secret information network connecting all the shrines in Japan, and Lukako was one of its members...[%p]
...Nah.[%p]
My old habits were coming back.[%p]
It would be rude not to pick up, wouldn’t it?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hello? Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, Okabe-san. S-Sorry, are you free right now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. What’s up?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... actually there was something I wanted to talk to you about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Something you wanted to talk to me about?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Can I come over now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now? Is it something you can’t say on the phone?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes... Kind of.”[%p]
Right now?[%p]
Would it be ok to leave this to Daru and Suzuha?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Sorry. Someone’s coming over now.”[%p]
I was interested to see what kind of person Daru’s friend was.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ho capito...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can it wait until after that?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve got something to do later...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ho capito.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So, how about...”[%p]
Just as Lukako was about to say something—[%p]
Ho sentito dei passi taglienti salire le scale.[%p]
E poi qualcuno che bussa alla porta.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Avanti!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, Lukako. She’s here. I’ll talk to you later—”[%p]
And then I stopped.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Co—”[%p]
La persona che ha aperto la porta...[%p]
Era...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](—Lei? Ancora?!)[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Era Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
Non l’avevo più vista sin dal seminario all’ATF.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... Okabe-san? What’s wrong? Okabe-san?”[%p]
The call ended before I could answer.[%p]
Sorry, I’ll call back later. I just have to deal with this right now.[%p]
I apologized to Lukako in my mind...[%p]
And then he sent me a RINE message.[%p]
Was he in a big hurry?[%p]
I got a little worried, so I checked the message right away.[%p]
He was in a big hurry.[%p]
It must have been something important.[%p]
Maybe I should’ve picked up the phone.[%p]
Just as I was about to call back—[%p]
Ho sentito dei passi taglienti salire le scale.[%p]
E poi qualcuno che bussa alla porta.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Avanti!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Co—”[%p]
La persona che ha aperto la porta...[%p]
Era...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](—Lei? Ancora?!)[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Era Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
Non l’avevo più vista sin dal seminario all’ATF.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Have something to drink.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka was silent, with her head tilted slightly forward. Seeing her caused a dull ache within me, like my heart was being squeezed dry.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](Why...?)[%p]
Why was she here with Daru?[%p]
I had any number of doubts in my mind.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Qualcosa non va, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Non è niente...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...?”[%p]
Moeka tilted her head a bit to the side, and I quickly averted my eyes.[%p]
There was no connection between SERN and us anymore.[%p]
E quindi non aveva intenzione di uccidere Mayuri.[%p]
Lei non avrebbe ucciso Mayuri.[%p]
Lei non avrebbe ucciso Mayuri.[%p]
Lei non l’avrebbe uccisa.[%p]
I said it to myself over and over again, and finally started to relax.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, you look pale. You doing ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry about me... Anyway, Daru, can you explain what’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, this is Kiryu-shi. She works at an [color index="280AA02D1400"]società editoriale[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Kiryu... Moeka.”[%p]
She silently handed me her business card, which had the name of a company called [color index="280AA02D1400"]Arc Rewrite[color index="800000"] on it.[%p]
Daru gave a brief explanation to me and Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Daru... How did you meet her?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Her magazine once did a special on Akihabara [color index="280AA02D1400"]leggende urbane[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And so I got a request to talk about my part-time job.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s not something I can really talk about, you know? So I politely refused, but...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I normally try to make myself hard to track down. But Kiryu-shi was able to find me. That got my attention.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And once I met her, as you can see, I found out she was really hot.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“A hot writer who tracks down leggende urbane? Isn’t that the most anime thing ever?”[%p]
And that’s how they’d met.[%p]
Suzuha was frowning as she saw how Daru acted around Moeka.[%p]
She didn’t say anything, but I could tell she was thinking that he’d be better off directing his attentions toward her mom.[%p]
Moeka, for her part, seemed completely uninterested in Daru. She was wearing her usual poker face and fiddling with her phone.[%p]
She’s still using a Japanese feature phone instead of a smart phone, huh?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, it’s not exactly her specialty, but she knows a lot about Akihabara. Especially about some of the underground stuff, I guess? So I thought it might be worth asking her.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...You’re looking for someone. That’s what I heard.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yup. Actually, we want you to find a girl who went missing 12 years ago in Akihabara.”[%p]
Daru told Kiryu Moeka the basic story.[%p]
She was dead silent the whole time, but she typed his words into her phone with incredible speed.[%p]
I said nothing and just watched.[%p]
She was once a Rounder.[%p]
She probably still was.[%p]
Was it ok to trust her?[%p]
It was just a coincidence that I’d run into her here.[%p]
I knew that in my head, but my heart just refused to accept it.[%p]
Here in the linea di universo Beta, we’d never encountered Kiryu Moeka before.[%p]
Of course we hadn’t.[%p]
I’d chosen the linea di universo Beta so that we wouldn’t.[%p]
Even though the cost was Makise Kurisu’s life.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...In other words... you want me to find this Shiina Kagari person?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s right. Can you help?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I... can try...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Davvero?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“But... I don’t know if I’ll find her...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course. If you can’t, you can’t.”[%p]
Normally, Moeka and I would never have run into each other like this.[%p]
Of course, we might have crossed paths in Akihabara.[%p]
We almost ran into each other when she’d come to interview Dr. Leskinen and Maho at the ATF seminar.[%p]
But I’d convinced myself that we were never going to meet each other directly.[%p]
Was this fate?[%p]
Were she and I fated to cross paths at some point?[%p]
If that was the case... maybe it was better not to try to avoid her, but to watch her to see what she did.[%p]
As I listened to Daru talk to her, that was what I started to think.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So we’ll pay you if you succeed, and then any other necessary expenses. Kk?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No problem.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, Suzuha, you two ok with that?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If she can help, I’m not going to complain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I don’t mind... either.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s a deal, then.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka nodded slightly, and then asked us for information about Kagari that might be a clue. Stuff like the clothes she was wearing when she disappeared and what she looked like. After that, she left.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whew...”[%p]
All the tension suddenly drained from my body as I sank into the sofa.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, are you sure you’re ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine. I was just a little nervous.”[%p]
It was a little late, but I took some anxiety meds out of my pocket and swallowed them.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, you knew that Kiryu Moeka girl, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
She could tell?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously? When did that happen, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Why did you think so?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I could tell by looking at you.”[%p]
I guess you have to be pretty sharp to survive on the battlefield.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No, I don’t know her.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Did you know her in the linea di universo Alfa?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ok. I won’t ask any more, but I’ll do my best to keep an eye on her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...That’s enough. For now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What are you guys talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I got nervous, is all.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I understand that. She’s hot, has giant boobs, great proportions, and she even wears glasses. You can’t help it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
If she was a part of my life now, I would just have to use her as best I could.[%p]
Maybe it was because she was gone now, or maybe it was because of the anxiety meds, but I’d calmed down enough to start thinking that way.[%p]
Of course, who knew if I’d feel the same way the next time I saw her, face-to-face.[%p]
