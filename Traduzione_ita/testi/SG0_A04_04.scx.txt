[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I looked at the phone I was holding in my hand.[%p]
The date read January 31st, 2011.[%p]
No doubt about it.[%p]
Sono tornato.[%p]
Sono finalmente tornato qui.[%p]
Ho attraversato a ritroso così tanti anni.[%p]
Ho completato migliaia di salti temporali.[%p]
Gone through the war...[%p]
I’d almost died.[%p]
I’d thought of giving up a bunch of times.[%p]
But each time, I’d remembered it all.[%p]
That ruined world.[%p]
The piles of corpses.[%p]
The screams.[%p]
The shouting.[%p]
The dripping blood.[%p]
And Daru and Maho, and how they’d sent me off.[%p]
After a long, long, unimaginably long time, I’d finally made it back to this time.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Did you get some bad news or something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh...?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’ve been kind of spacing out since you picked up the phone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“N-No, that’s not it. That’s not it...”[%p]
Mayuri era qui.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Are you still thinking about New Year’s, meowbe?”[%p]
Faris was here.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Get a hold of yourself, man.”[%p]
And Daru.[%p]
And Lukako.[%p]
And Suzuha.[%p]
And...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...?”[%p]
Maho and Kagari were here, too.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Are you feeling tired after what we did earlier?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Earlier?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You know, when we took the samples of your memories for Amadeus?”[%p]
Ah, giusto.[%p]
Daru had mentioned that.[%p]
He’d said it was at the end of January.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not it. Just... you know.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm? What is it, Okarin-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You still can’t remember what happened since you came to this time?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh? Y-Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Capisco...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why do you ask?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No reason. I just wanted to make sure.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What? You’re being weird, Okarin-san.”[%p]
Since I’d come from the future, I knew.[%p]
In this linea di universo, Kurisu’s memories no longer existed inside Kagari’s head.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But it doesn’t really bother me anymore, though.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I mean, Mamma’s here, and Luka-kun’s here, and Big Sis Rumi is here, too. And there’s lots of food, too. So maybe I don’t need to force myself to remember.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Capisco...”[%p]
Maybe that was fine, for now.[%p]
But the future was going to be filled with sorrow.[%p]
For Mayuri.[%p]
For Faris.[%p]
For Lukako.[%p]
For Daru.[%p]
For Suzuha.[%p]
For Kagari.[%p]
And for Maho.[%p]
Did I really make the right choice when I decided to let Kurisu die?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
After everyone had left, and I was alone, all the exhaustion came crashing down on me.[%p]
I’d time leaped 3000 times.[%p]
I thought I’d be able to work things out in my head along the way, but I’d been so desperate to return to the past that I hadn’t had time.[%p]
My mind was worn down after all the time leaps.[%p]
I thought I’d made my decision, but I’d found myself wavering again and again.[%p]
I’d only managed to do it by telling myself that I had to get back before I could make any decisions.[%p]
And now my head just felt so tired.[%p]
What should I do now?[%p]
Cosa dovrei fare?[%p]
For now, I didn’t want to think about anything.[%p]
But I felt too awake to even sleep.[%p]
With everyone gone, the temperature in the lab quickly dropped. It was freezing.[%p]
But it was nothing compared to the cold I’d felt before.[%p]
That world I’d seen right after I’d erased Kurisu’s memories from Kagari...[%p]
Kurisu was there, Mayuri was there... Everyone was there.[%p]
It was a scene from that very brief peace I’d had during that summer.[%p]
But that world had been so cold.[%p]
And now I knew why.[%p]
That was the world that I’d experienced when I was asleep, existing only as data.[%p]
A world built only of 0s and 1s.[%p]
Like being alive, even when you’re dead,[%p]
or being forced to stay alive, even though you were dead.[%p]
The people I loved were there.[%p]
But there was no warmth.[%p]
I could reach out and touch them...[%p]
But there wasn’t even a little bit of warmth.[%p]
It was like floating in deep, dark space, without any light at all.[%p]
And Makise Kurisu was now experiencing that, too.[%p]
She was all alone in a cold world, without the slightest trace of warmth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I raised my hand up under the fluorescent light.[%p]
I could see the veins rising up out of it, and the red blood flowing in them.[%p]
I was alive.[%p]
There was warmth.[%p]
But could I really say that I was alive?[%p]
Now that my memories had been digitized...[%p]
After being exposed to that cold world, could I still really be called human?[%p]
I heard a knock at the door and turned my eyes toward it.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho was standing there.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san... I thought you went home?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I forgot something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Forgot something?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Anyway, what are you doing here all by yourself?”[%p]
Maho showed no signs of looking for whatever she had lost. Instead she came right up and sat down in front of me.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’ve had that pensive look on your face for a long time now. Is something bothering you?”[%p]
Maybe she’d been worried enough to come back and check on me?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t take Kurisu’s place, but I can still talk to you if you want.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san...”[%p]
There was no need to worry about whether I could tell her or not.[%p]
I needed her to make the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
And for that, she needed to hear everything.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not exactly easy to believe, but will you listen to me anyway?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Sheesh. What’s your problem?”[%p]
That was the first thing she’d said after I finished.[%p]
Just like last time, it wasn’t something that was easy for her to believe.[%p]
But Maho must’ve sensed something in the way I spoke, because she listened until I finished.[%p]
She interrupted me whenever there was something she didn’t understand.[%p]
She was especially interested in the time machine and the time leaps.[%p]
I told her everything I knew about them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Will you believe me...?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t have a choice, after seeing the look on your face. And...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“After seeing this, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“This answers something I’d always wondered about.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kurisu had died only a short while after coming to Akihabara. Could you really have gotten to know her in that short span of time?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Especially knowing how she is, right? I thought something must’ve gone on for her to get so close to a boy that fast...”[%p]
“So that was it,” she whispered to herself.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And? So what’s on your mind?”[%p]
I turned away from her.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Am I... me?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Che cosa vuoi dire?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You heard what I said, right? My memories were turned into data and stored on a hard drive.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You could call them artificial memories, if you wanted.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you really say that I’m me anymore?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you really say that I’m alive?”[%p]
There was blood running through my body.[%p]
But what was in my head had been changed into 0s and 1s.[%p]
Didn’t that make me no different than Amadeus?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s what’s bothering you? That’s stupid.”[%p]
But Maho just laughed at my worries.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Have you ever heard of a [color index="280AA02D1400"]zombie filosofico[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s... a thought experiment, right? Something that looks and behaves just like a human, but lacks consciousness and emotions... And whether or not you could objectively distinguish it from a human.”[%p]
I hesitated a little as I answered her sudden question.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Well, that’s basically right.”[%p]
She nodded, satisfied, like a teacher would do.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Then let’s say that right here there was an AI that looked just like a human.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It looks like a human, and acts just like one, too.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“When someone’s in trouble, it reaches out to help them, and when it’s sad, it cries.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Maybe those are just preprogrammed processes, but humans are no different. Everyone thinks and reacts in accordance with their own individual processes.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“We just happen to call these processes things like ‘consciousness’ and ‘feelings.’”[%p]
I thought I understood what Maho was trying to say.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words, AIs have feelings, too?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“At least, we scientists are doing our best to create them.”[%p]
She puffed out her chest with pride.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So, Okabe-san. Do you think you’re not an AI with emotions?”[%p]
If they looked just like a person, and thought just like them, and had feelings, too...[%p]
They were a person.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Right? It’s memories that make someone who they are, anyway.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Memories are everything people have experienced since they were born.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So, Okabe Rintaro. Even if your memories were once data, you’ve got your body and your memories. You’re human. You’re Okabe Rintaro. Don’t worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And anyway, doesn’t Kurisu’s Time Leap Machine digitize data to send it back in time?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So is there any need to worry about this now?”[%p]
That was what Daru had told me in the future, too.[%p]
But strangely, when she said it, it made me feel better.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Maybe Kurisu would’ve been able to come up with a better way to put it, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not true. This was more than enough.”[%p]
Maho had given her opinion, as a brain scientist, that I was still me.[%p]
There was a strength in her words, just like there had been in Kurisu’s when she’d driven me forward.[%p]
I remembered what Maho had said before—[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re a genius, and in the end, I’m just Salieri.”[%p]
She’d been speaking to the memories of Kurisu inside Kagari.[%p]
Però—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san, you’re not Salieri.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re Amadeus.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
I’m here, right now.[%p]
I’m alive, and here in this time, not in that cold sea of black data.[%p]
I’m here in this time.[%p]
A light came on in the darkness.[%p]
My cold heart began to warm.[%p]
Però—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu—she was still trapped inside that world.[%p]
Inside that sterile, lifeless world that froze you to the depths of your soul.[%p]
Even after her death, her memories were still alive.[%p]
And there were all kinds of conspiracies forming around her living memories.[%p]
Even after she lost her body, Kurisu’s pain continued.[%p]
No, it wasn’t just Kurisu.[%p]
Kagari, and Suzuha,[%p]
and in the future, Mayuri, Faris, Lukako, and Daru, too.[%p]
Everyone was suffering, everyone was miserable, but still they tried to move forward.[%p]
All I had cared about was whether Mayuri survived.[%p]
I thought that even if the Third World War came, no matter what happened to the world, as long as Mayuri was happy, that was all that mattered.[%p]
I tried to think that.[%p]
I thought that no matter how much blood and tears awaited us in the future, as long as things were fine now, that was all that mattered.[%p]
I thought I’d understood.[%p]
I thought I’d understood how awful the future that Suzuha described was.[%p]
And how hard Daru and Suzuha would have to fight.[%p]
I thought I understood all that.[%p]
Suzuha, firing her gun and staining her hands with blood like it was nothing at all.[%p]
Mayuri and Faris, pale and colorless.[%p]
Lukako lying on the ground and never getting up again.[%p]
Kagari and the others, whose lives were ruined by fate.[%p]
I’d seen them with my own eyes and touched them with my own hands, and then I finally understood.[%p]
I’d been only pretending to know, so I could run away.[%p]
I’d told myself that I was going to die in 2025, and looked the other way.[%p]
2025—[%p]
I wasn’t dead.[%p]
Everyone just thought so.[%p]
Everyone had been deceived.[%p]
That’s right, deceived.[%p]
Me in the past,[%p]
and everyone else in the future.[%p]
The world—was deceived.[%p]
I thought the future was settled.[%p]
But a different future awaited me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Il cammino verso Steins Gate è difficile. Riprovare una o due volte probabilmente non ti porterà lì.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ma io credo che partire da lì sia il modo migliore per arrivarci. That’s what you said 11 years ago.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Quindi questo mondo in cui ci troviamo non è sprecato. È un mondo di cui abbiamo bisogno. O almeno, questo è quello che penso io.”[%p]
I had no way of knowing what would make me say that fourteen years from now.[%p]
All I knew was that fourteen years from now, I would know this day was coming.[%p]
So maybe—maybe I should do what I said.[%p]
If that future in 2036 was necessary, then maybe a world where [Kurisu] was released from her electronic prison was necessary, too.[%p]
No matter how hard the path would be, I had to take the first step.[%p]
And what I needed right now was that first step.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Cosa c’è?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you help me a little more before you go back to America?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hmm. Ok, but on two conditions.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Conditions?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“First, you let me look at that time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And second?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re going to let me call you Okarin-san. You’ll call me Maho.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t think they’re too much, do you?”[%p]
There was an innocent smile on her face the likes of which I’d never seen before.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...All right, Maho.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thanks, Okarin-san.”[%p]
When she put her small hand against mine, I felt a solid warmth.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What is it, Okarin? Why did mew call me back after I already left?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s right. I don’t live that close to here. If you wanted to talk about something, you should’ve said so before I left.”[%p]
I’d called all the lab mems back after they’d left to go home, and they weren’t happy.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, what did you want to talk about, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Is it something you couldn’t tell us on RINE or the phone?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, but first, Suzuha.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Che c’è?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have a question. What do you think about me?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What... do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, Okarin—you can’t!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“E-Even for you, Okarin, I’m not giving you Suzuha! Daddy won’t allow it! Never!”[%p]
I ignored Daru, who seemed to have gotten the wrong idea completely, and turned back toward Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve been watching me since last summer. What have you been thinking about me? I want your honest opinion.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ne sei sicuro?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ad essere onesti, you’ve been pissing me off.”[%p]
Yeah, that was honest. I chuckled.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not just me, Dad, and Big Sis Mayu. It’s Big Sis Rumi, and Brother Luka, and Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In the future, everyone suffers. They don’t even know if they’re going to be alive tomorrow. They might die horribly, like my mom did.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And they’re trying their best to survive anyway.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But all you do is whine and act like you’re the only person in the world with problems.”[%p]
Once she started talking, she didn’t stop.[%p]
This must’ve been building up for a long time.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Of course, I know you’ve been through a lot. I know you’ve suffered again and again, until finally you couldn’t go on.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But you’re all we have, Uncle Okarin.”[%p]
She looked down, clenched her fists, and grit her teeth.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If I could take your place, I’d do anything! No matter what I had to go through, no matter how much it hurt, I’d do it!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Suzuha...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But there’s nothing we can do... You’re the only one who can do anything.”[%p]
She suddenly looked up, and I could see on her face all the complicated feelings she’d been holding back.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But all you do is talk about how it’s impossible, or you can’t do it, or you don’t want to! You just whine, and you won’t even listen to me!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I never said anything because Dad was around, but you’ve always pissed me off!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A lot of the time, I’ve just wanted to punch you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Heh.”[%p]
It probably felt good to get that off her chest.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“S-Suzuha, you don’t need to go that far...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyat’s right. Okarin understands, nya.”[%p]
I did understand, yeah.[%p]
I understood that something had to be done.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then why not do it?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Do what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You wanted to hit me, right? Then hit me!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? But...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No need to hold back.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san, stop it. Okarin is...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s fine, Mayuri.”[%p]
This was my way of settling things.[%p]
With Suzuha.[%p]
With the future.[%p]
And with myself.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is that... Is that your fetish? Then I guess I won’t stop you, but...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re really sure?”[%p]
Suzuha took a step toward me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
I was ready.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“All right. This is gonna hurt.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh? No, wait—You can go easy—”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yah!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“BWAGH!”[%p]
She hit me hard enough to knock me across the room.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, sorry. I guess I put a little too much force into it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I-I just heard a really loud crunch!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A-Are you ok, Okarin?”[%p]
Everyone ran over and looked down at me.[%p]
Yeah, that hurt a lot.[%p]
It probably did more damage to my brain than Reading Steiner or the time leaps.[%p]
Però—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san?”[%p]
It woke me up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh...”[%p]
Now I just had to do what I could.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahaha...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“FWAHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I-Is that... Kyouma?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am Hououin... Kyouma.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kyouma-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes! My name is Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lab Mem 001, the founder of this lab. The Seeker of Chaos, the mad scientist who will overthrow the struttura di controllo del mondo, Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“R-Right!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Bring me my lab coat!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“R-Right! Oka- I mean, Kyouma-san!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... Kyouma is back, nya!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“D-Dad... what is this?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You did it, Suzuha. Okarin’s finally ready to fight.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“There you go, Kyouma-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed.”[%p]
I put my lab coat on for the first time in a very long time. It had been sitting on the shelf in the back so long that it smelled a little moldy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right! This is it! This is my holy silver armor! At this moment, Hououin Kyouma has awakened! He has revived from his long slumber! FWAHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
Kagari and Maho were seeing Hououin Kyouma for the first time, and they were shocked into silence.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...W-What just happened? Did that punch drive him crazy?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I remember now...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hououin Kyouma... Mamma used to talk about him all the time.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“She said that someday, Hououin Kyouma would come back to life... and bring light to our future.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...I’m having a really hard time keeping up with all this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You! Loliputian!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What the heck is going on...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You. I’m talking to you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Wh—?! You’re not talking to me, are you?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come now, Loliputian, who else would be worthy of such a moniker?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Who are you calling a Loliputian?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I give you the honor of being Lab Mem 009! You shall be my servant and participate in our operations!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Why do I have to be your servant? And what the hell is a lab mem?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just like the name suggests, it means you’re an official member of this lab. You must feel very honored.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Honored...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Next! Shiina Kagari!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Fweeh?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re Lab Mem 010! Got it?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“O-Ok!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Wait, Kyouma! We don’t get to be lab mems, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
Faris and Lukako seemed upset.[%p]
Come to think of it, I’d made them lab mems in the linea di universo Alfa, but not this one.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I never told you, but of course, you are already lab mems!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako is 006. Faris is 007. And Suzuha is 008! Got it?”[%p]
