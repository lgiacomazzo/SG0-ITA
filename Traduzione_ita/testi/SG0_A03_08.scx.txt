[name]Maho[line](I can’t believe it...)[%p]
[name]Maho[line](No, but it’s true, isn’t it?)[%p]
On the train back, Hiyajo Maho was having trouble controlling her excitement.[%p]
Two girls who said they came from the future.[%p]
And Okabe Rintaro’s story about the Macchina per il Salto Temporale.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Normally, she’d never believe them.[%p]
But if Makise Kurisu’s mind had made these things possible, she could accept them.[%e]
Kurisu was a genius. She just might be capable of it.[%p]
To Maho, Kurisu seemed capable of anything.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And most of all, she’d seen it for herself.[%p]
On the way back from the lab, Suzuha had taken her to the top of Radi-Kan...[%p]
[margin top="38"]And showed her a real time machine.[%e]
It was night, and she didn’t have a lot of time to look at it closely, but she could tell at a glance that it wasn’t made with modern technology.[%p]
Honestly, she wanted to start work on making another one tomorrow. No, right now, even.[%p]
But she had something to do first.[%e]
The Macchina per il Salto Temporale that Kurisu had made...[%p]
She needed to make an improved version.[%p]
That meant she was going to be practically living at Okabe’s lab for a while.[%p]
So she decided to get what she needed from the office in Wako City.[%e]
From outside the building, she could see that the lights were still on despite the late hour.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Maho!”[%p]
As soon as she got inside, dottor Leskinen rushed over, his face pale.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“What... what happened here?”[%p]
The room had clearly been ransacked.[%p]
Of course, the place barely had anything in it to begin with, so with a quick glance it was hard to see what had changed.[%p]
But Maho and dottor Leskinen’s desks had clearly been searched.[%p]
The drawers had been locked, but the locks had been broken and their contents spilled out.[%p]
Dr. Reyes hadn’t brought much of anything, fortunately, and so she’d escaped with very little damage. But her drawers had been dumped out, too.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“What happened here?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Someone broke in.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A thief?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“It was like this when I got here. It might be espionage.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In an empty office like this?”[%p]
Wouldn’t it make more sense to hit the RIKEN Institute next door?[%p]
Only a few people even knew this office existed to begin with.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suddenly Okabe’s words began to take on a new meaning for her.[%p]
Could this have something to do with what he’d said?[%p]
Was a secret war over the time machine already beginning?[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Anyway, Maho, I want you to see if anything’s been stolen from your things.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“O-Ok...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Well? Was anything taken?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No, nothing of mine.”[%p]
She checked the desk and the drawers, and couldn’t find a single thing missing.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“What about you two?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I don’t seem to have lost anything, either.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“I looked at my computer, but I don’t see any trace of access by a third party.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“You’re sure nothing was stolen?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Come to think of it, Maho, what about your laptop? Was that stolen?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, I left that at the hotel. It should be fine.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“I see. I hope you’re right.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“What do we do? Call the police?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“If nothing was stolen, it might not do us any good to make a fuss.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“You’re right... Maybe we should just wait and see what happens.”[%p]
Maho wasn’t sure that was a good idea, but she could understand that going to the police would be a big hassle.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Especially since they weren’t Japanese to begin with.[%p]
And more than anything, dottor Leskinen probably didn’t want to lose time that could be spent on research.[%p]
The same was true of Maho, too.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Actually, professor, I need a favor—”[%p]
Il dottor Leskinen agreed to give her a vacation much more readily than she expected.[%p]
Maybe coming to the office over New Year’s had paid off.[%p]
Now she’d be able to focus on the Macchina per il Salto Temporale.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Once she got back to her hotel room, she quickly got her things ready.[%p]
She wasn’t checking out of the hotel, but she needed clothes and other things so she could stay at the lab for a while.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Ok, the last thing I need is...”[%p]
Once she finished packing her bag, she grabbed another bag that was placed next to it.[%p]
It was a laptop and portable hard drive that she’d gotten from Kurisu’s mother after her death.[%p]
She’d tried many times to crack the password, but never managed to succeed.[%p]
She knew that she wouldn’t have time to do anything with it, but she still didn’t want to leave it here.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. Wasn’t he—”[%p]
After she made one last check of her things and got ready to leave the room, an idea came to her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—Not a bad idea, if I do say so myself.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—Maybe this is what Kurisu wanted?[%p]
[margin top="38"]She quickly shook her head and chased the idea from her mind.[%e]
Kurisu would get mad at her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Life and death were like a binary, 0 and 1.[%p]
[margin top="38"]You could be one or the other.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There was no will that existed after death.[%p]
If it existed at all,[%p]
it existed inside the brain.[%e]
