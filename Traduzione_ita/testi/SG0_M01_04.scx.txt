I sighed a little as I got off the train at Akihabara.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come to think of it, I’ve come to Akihabara five days in a row.”[%p]
New Year’s was our trip to the shrine.[%p]
On the 2nd, I’d come to deal with the aftermath of that. And then the linea di universo had changed.[%p]
On the 3rd, I’d come to check on Maho and Moeka.[%p]
On the 4th—that is, yesterday—Mayuri had invited me to a New Year’s party at MayQueen.[%p]
I hadn’t come to Akihabara every day like this since last summer.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s going on with Feris-chan, you think?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know. I never can tell what she’s thinking.”[%p]
There was a reason I’d brought Mayuri to Akihabara.[%p]
Basically, something bad had happened at Faris’s house, and she wanted my help.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did something happen to Hiyajo-san and Moeka?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Everything seemed normal when I talked to Faris yesterday...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Questo non è vero.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan has been working really hard the last few weeks, and she’s getting really tired.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But she never complains. No matter how hard it gets, she’s always cheerful.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But this time, she’s actually come to you for help.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Something really bad must’ve happened, maybe...?”[%p]
We decided to hurry to Faris’s house.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
We called Faris’s condo from the piano terra entrance, but there was no answer.[%p]
Was Kuroki-san not in?[%p]
But at least Maho and Moeka should be...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They’re not answering, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s strange.”[%p]
I tried again, and this time got a response.[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“Hello...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um, this is Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“Yes... The mistress told me... Come on up...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
Mayuri and I looked at each other, shocked by the tone of his voice.[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“...”[%p]
Even when he came to greet us, Kuroki-san was too exhausted to give his usual elegant welcome.[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“Okabe...sama...”[%p]
Kuroki called my name, weakly, and in the next moment he collapsed to his knees like a puppet with its strings cut.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“K-Kuroki-san?!”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“At this rate, the Akiha clan is doomed...”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“Aah...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hawawawa?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“K-Kuroki-san? What’s wrong?!”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“Okabe-sama... You must escape. You mustn’t stay here...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened?”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“I don’t know... I can’t believe the things I’ve seen...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Seen? What did you see?”[%p]
Kuroki-san tried to say something, but then gave up and shook his head.[%p]
And then he slowly raised his arm and pointed to the end of the hallway.[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“The guest room... In there...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cos—?!”[%p]
That’s where Maho and Moeka were! Did something happen to them?![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Take care of Kuroki-san!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O-Ok!”[%p]
I left Kuroki-san in Mayuri’s care and ran to the guest room.[%p]
The door to the guest room was shut.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san! Kiryu Moeka! Are you all right?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Either of you, answer me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn it! I’m coming in!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—What?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How could this have happened...!”[%p]
I couldn’t believe my eyes.[%p]
—The scene was indescribable.[%p]
The only words I could come up with were “a palace of junk.”[%p]
The desk and bed were still where they’d been, but everything else had changed.[%p]
Books, notepads, and other strange objects were piled up to the ceiling in layers.[%p]
What may have started as a temporary pile of books had become a wall that reached to the top of the room.[%p]
Walls made of hundreds of books were scattered about the room, forming a small labyrinth. In some places the path was so narrow you need to turn sideways to get through.[%p]
The light from the ceiling no longer reached the floor, so small lights had been set up on top of the carpet. They were like torches in an underground labyrinth.[%p]
Strangely, the space wasn’t dirty.[%p]
The result of Maho and Moeka’s attempts to maximize their creative output was the construction of a labyrinth in the guest room. In a sense, it was the highest application of the principles of functional beauty.[%p]
But it was still a palace of junk.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho was humming as she typed into her keyboard. She had a big pair of headphones on.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka was kneeling on the carpet with her legs splayed, typing into her laptop at the low table. She, too, was wearing headphones.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...?”[%p]
Maho saw me standing in shock at the entrance and took off her headphones.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, Okabe-san. Hello.”[%p]
Moeka took her earphones off, too.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Hello.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, this room is amazing, huh?”[%p]
Mayuri was so astonished she couldn’t think of anything else to say.[%p]
Did these two realize how much it took to freak out Mayuri?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What’s wrong, you two?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, ‘What’s wrong’?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the hell happened to this room?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The room...?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Is there something strange about it?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Everything’s strange about it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It wasn’t like this two days ago...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, is that it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The passage of time brings change. For things, and people, and of course, rooms.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What do you think? It’s so much more functional this way, isn’t it?”[%p]
The fact that Maho didn’t seem to find anything wrong with this at all made my head hurt.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It looks like you could go on an adventure!”[%p]
For her part, Mayuri was wandering through the labyrinth, excited.[%p]
There were screens to divide the different parts of the room. The screens were different-colored pieces of babydoll lingerie.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, these are cute.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I chose the colors when I hung them...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, you’re right. Moeka-san, you’ve got lots of grown-up underwear, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, I’m sorry, but can you leave before this discussion gets any more complicated?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, sure.”[%p]
I tried talking to Maho and Moeka, but couldn’t get any useful information.[%p]
When it came down to it, neither of them understood that this room was as messy as you could get.[%p]
Everything they needed was always within arm’s reach, so the two of them thought of it as a pleasant place to work and live.[%p]
This was definitely the reason why Faris had come to me for help, and why Kuroki-san seemed to be on the verge of death.[%p]
Kuroki-san, the Akiha family’s ultimate butler, had a policy of not letting a single speck of dust exist in a room.[%p]
These two must have driven him over the edge.[%p]
That explained the terror in his eyes.[%p]
He’d probably tried to clean this room up when they first started living here.[%p]
Thinking back, he’d been acting strange when I came here two days ago.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But why did Faris come to me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And I don’t know why she told me to bring Mayuri either.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Mayushii had a brilliant idea!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan probably wants this room cleaned up! That’s why she called Mayushii.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you’d come alone, you might’ve given up, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uh...”[%p]
Yeah, probably.[%p]
I was looking at an entirely new structure. It wasn’t something you could just “clean up.”[%p]
If I’d come alone, I might’ve just turned tail and run.[%p]
It would take a team of professional cleaners a full day to clean this thing up.[%p]
This wouldn’t be worth it unless I was getting paid.[%p]
I wanted to complain, but I was the one who’d asked Faris to let Maho stay here...[%p]
I had to do it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re cleaning this room up today.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No complaints, ok? It’s the lady of the house’s orders.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Davvero?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m not sure I agree, but whatever. Got it.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ok...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll have to call everyone I can think of to come help. But where do we even start...?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I know!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii had another brilliant idea!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why don’t we get Sergeant Clean to help?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sergeant Clean? What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sergeant Clean is very good at cleaning!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The messier the room, the stronger their power level grows, they say!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know... them?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup! It’s someone you know really well!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh? Someone I know well?”[%p]
Mayuri brought me to the lab.[%p]
Or more precisely, the Braun Tube Workshop on the piano terra of the building where the lab was.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nae-chan! Tutturu♪!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Tutturu♪!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Hello, Uncle Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Mayuri, is Nae your ‘Sergeant Clean’?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup, that’s right!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nae-chan’s really good at cleaning!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She cleans the store and her home every day, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-Do you?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I do.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Papà wipes down the Braun tubes every day, but I do all the rest myself.”[%p]
Come to think of it, I’d never seen any garbage on the floor of the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Oh, it’s not that daddy doesn’t like cleaning. I just really love it.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Whenever I see garbage on the floor, I feel like I have to pick it up!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Mamma used to always say that a messy room indicated a messy mind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see... But why Sergeant Clean?”[%p]
Nae’s eyes went wide and her face blushed.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“B-Sorellona Mayuri?!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I told you not to tell anyone!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sorry. But we need Sergeant Clean’s help!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I-I’m not a sergeant or anything like that!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I just get a little excited when I’m cleaning!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“It’s true!”[%p]
Nae looked to be on the verge of tears.[%p]
Well, a girl her age wouldn’t want to be called ‘Sergeant,’ maybe...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Nae-chan, can you do it? Can you help Mayushii and her friends?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“You won’t call me ‘Sergeant’ anymore?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. I won’t.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Then ok!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’ll clean! I want to go to Miss Kitty’s house, too!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Oh, but I don’t want to go alone...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t worry! Everybody will come with you! Right, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. I’ll ask everybody I can find.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Ok! I’ll go get ready, so wait for me!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’ll go home and get the hat!”[%p]
Nae ran off toward the station.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...The hat? What’s she talking about?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’ll know soon!”[%p]
—30 minutes later...[%p]
Fubuki, Kaede, and Daru were the ones who answered my call.[%p]
We met up with Nae and headed to the garbage pit that Faris’s condo had become.[%p]
E quindi...[%p]
Sergeant Clean revealed herself before us.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I am Sergeant Clean, your drill instructor!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Listen up! Until this room is clean, you are inchworms! The lowest form of life on Earth!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“You people are not appliances! You aren’t worthy of being called vacuum cleaners!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“You’re only good for stretching out and squeezing up on top of a leaf!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Because I am hard, you will not like me. But the more you hate me, the more you will learn.”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“I am hard, but I am fair. I’m only interested in getting this room sparkling clean!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Got it, inchworms?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“M-Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Che cosa c’è?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-What the hell is that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nae-chan’s personality kind of changes when she cleans, you see.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not a personality change! She’s a totally different person!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“A cute little loli reveals herself to be a sadistic sergeant that cusses you out... In our world, that’s a good thing!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru... Chill out.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I hope she gets nice and flirty once we’re done cleaning.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like, ‘Now that the room’s clean, I’ll clean you up!’”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Who said that?!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Aah! Ma’am, I said it, ma’am!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“No talking! The only words out of your filthy sewer holes will be ‘yes’ and ‘no,’ got it?”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“And you will say ‘Nae-sama’ before every word! Got it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nae-sama, sì, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can’t believe I get a real loli cussing me out... Today’s my lucky day!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“What are you grinning about?!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Aah!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Listen up! From now on, your name is Mister Smileybear!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nae-sama, sì, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Do you like that name, Mister Smileybear?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nae-sama, sì, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t know if it matters, but ‘Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!’ is really hard to say.”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“What?! You got a problem with that, Mister Smileybear?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nae-sama, no, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Are you screwing with me, Mister Smileybear?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nae-sama, no, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Now hop to it, Mister Smileybear! I want you to wax the floor in the hallway ten times in the next 30 seconds!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Hop to it! Go! One, two, three!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nae-sama, sì, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hahh...Hahh... More insults, please!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“At least one person is enjoying this, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe we were lucky that Yuki-san couldn’t make it today.”[%p]
Kaede and Fubuki happened to be in Akihabara, so they had offered to help, but Yuki had work and couldn’t make it.[%p]
For the sake of the Hashida family’s future, I was glad.[%p]
Maho and Moeka had already given up on trying to match Nae’s high energy, and were taking their time washing the windows on the veranda.[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Ok, next!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“You, the pretty girls!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“M-Me?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Pretty? You think so?”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Tell me, why did you join my beloved corps?!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Um, we just came because we were asked to...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Yeah. What’s going on here?”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“I’m asking the questions here!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Aah!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“And you will answer my questions!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki & Kaede[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[linebreak][parallel]“Nae-sama... yes... Nae-sama?”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“I’ll ask you one more time!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Tell me why you volunteered for my corps!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Nae-sama! To clean! Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Then let me see your clean face!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“C-Clean face?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Come on, let’s go, Kaede-chan!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Huh? Wha—?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Ain’t cleaning hell?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fubuki-chan’s really getting into this, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurushima-san seems to be having a bit of a bad time.”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“You two! Why are you talking?”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Take that big, turgid, black thing down to the garbage dump!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Big, turgid, black... what?!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The garbage bag. Right?”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Yup! That’s right! Now get to work!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“I can’t hear you! You think you can clean this room like that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Put some damn energy into it! Louder!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Mayuri[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[linebreak][parallel]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“And the rest of you! If you’ve got time to grin, you’ve got time to carry garbage!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki & Kaede[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[linebreak][parallel]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“Once that’s done, we’re polishing every doorknob in the house until it shines!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Mayuri & Itaru[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[linebreak][parallel]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[linebreak][parallel]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[%p]
[name]Primo Sergente Tennouji[line]“You will not laugh! You will not cry! You will polish tables! And you will be glad to do it!”[%p]
[name]Personale addetto alla pulizia[line]“Nae-sama, yes, Nae-sama!”[%p]
And so the sergeant kept us cleaning until late into the night.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thank you so much for helping today, nya! I’m so happy, nya!”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“I was worried for a while, but thanks to you, I’ve recovered.”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“I made a special dinner tonight, so please enjoy.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’d like to ask today’s hero, Nae-nyan, to do the toast, nya!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“M-Me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the perfect person to do it, Sergeant.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“U-Uncle Okarin! You promised not to say that!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Aw, come on. You can do it, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“O-Ok!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Thank you all for helping clean today! Cin cin!”[%p]
[name]Tutti[line]“Cin cin!”[%p]
It took about half a day, but with Nae’s help, we finished the cleaning.[%p]
When Kuroki-san saw the cleaned room, he recovered and made us a huge dinner.[%p]
Nae had seemed like a totally different person during the cleaning, but now she was back to normal.[%p]
She was holding a cup filled with orange juice in both hands and happily talking to Kaede.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“So you can play the piano, Sorellona Kaede? Wow!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“It’s not that special...”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“I’m more interested in music history...”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“I can only play a few things...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“No, that’s amazing!”[%p]
Kaede’s modesty was only setting Nae off even more.[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Kaede-chan, why not play a song for Nae-sama? There’s a piano right over there.”[%p]
A small upright piano was in the corner of the living room.[%p]
It was perfect.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I want to hear the piano!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Huh? I’m not good enough to play for anyone.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I can’t play, so I know the piano would really be happy if you used it, nya!”[%p]
[name]Kuroki[line]“Of course, I keep it tuned at all times.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Aw, I don’t know...”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Ok, just one song.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Yay!”[%p]
Kaede sat in front of the piano and lifted the cover over the keys.[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Hmm... what should I play?”[%p]
She seemed happy as she stared at the keys in thought.[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Maybe you know this one, Nae-chan?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I do! The ‘Rondò alla Turca’!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“That’s right!”[%p]
Her ten fingers danced between the black and ivory keys, and a cheerful melody filled the room.[%p]
She’d been very modest, but it was clear that she had a lot of talent.[%p]
As the song played on, the rest of the group stopped talking and moved to the chairs and sofas around the piano.[%p]
E poi...[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho, who had been sitting next to me, suddenly stood up. The sound echoed throughout the room a little louder than she’d thought it would.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I-I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Don’t let it bother you...”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“You can all keep talking, ok?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho kept standing up, as if lost in thought.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san, is something wrong?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...No, it’s nothing.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I forgot that I had a call to make for work, that’s all.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sorry, I’ll be right back.”[%p]
Maho quietly left the room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
It felt like something was strange...[%p]
I thought for a moment, and then suddenly looked where she’d been sitting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
Maho’s phone was still on the seat.[%p]
So she wasn’t making a call after all.[%p]
I was a little worried, so I took her phone and left the living room.[%p]
The door to the guest room was open.[%p]
I peeked inside and saw that Maho was standing in the middle of the room with the lights off.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Posso entrare?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She didn’t tell me no, so I went inside and put the phone on the desk.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You left it on your chair.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t make any calls without this, huh?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Hahh...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thanks. I didn’t realize I’d forgotten it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I got really upset, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Upset?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want to talk about it, we can.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Va bene.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s not that big a deal, but maybe telling somebody would make me feel better.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You know the title of that song she was playing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The ‘Rondò alla Turca,’ right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah. It’s Mozart.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“More precisely, K331, Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 11, 3rd Movement.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sonata No.11 has three movements, and the third, the ‘Rondò alla Turca,’ is very famous.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But I actually like the melody from the first movement more.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And Kurisu said she did, too.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I was just remembering that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san, have you heard of a movie called Amadeus?”[%p]
I wasn’t sure how to handle the sudden change of subject.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know the basic plot, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s about a musician who was jealous of Mozart’s talents, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. Antonio Salieri.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In the movie, he’s depicted as a man whose life is ruined by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“He had a bright future as a musician, but Mozart’s god-given talents made him jealous and drove him to despair.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“While everyone else was bewildered by Mozart’s strange antics, he was the one person to see the talent underneath.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“The talents that gave him the name Amadeus, beloved of God.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Salieri was a hard worker. And he couldn’t handle the fact that Mozart’s innate talent brought him fame.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And finally, he drives Mozart to the brink.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Drives him to the brink?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In the end, he drives Mozart to his death.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is just in the movie, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t really know the details.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But I have heard that there were some strange circumstances surrounding Mozart’s death, and that he could have been poisoned.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“There’s a theory that Salieri may have poisoned him.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A month after Kurisu died, the school networks got a big update.”[%p]
Maho had jumped to another subject again.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And so we all had to pick new user names.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I picked ‘Salieri,’ without really thinking about it. I wanted it to go with the name of the AI, Amadeus.”[%p]
I knew that. I’d seen her log in once in Wako City’s offices.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But maybe there was more to it than that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“More to it? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Maybe I named myself Salieri not because of Amadeus, but because of Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“To me, Kurisu was Amadeus.”[%p]
In other words, Maho recognized Kurisu’s talent more than anyone, and at the same time, she was more jealous of her than anyone else in the world.[%p]
Just like Salieri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san...”[%p]
I didn’t know what to say. I could see Maho’s shoulders shaking a little.[%p]
E poi...[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Maho[line]“...”[linebreak][parallel]“...”[%p]
Both Maho and I turned in the direction of the noise.[%p]
Moeka was standing outside the door, looking troubled.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Scusate.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Che succede?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We need to get Tennouji-san back home.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right. I’ll walk her home. Just give me a second.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Hiyajo-san, you ok?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You look like you’re in pain.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Yeah. I’m fine.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I just haven’t moved around like this in a long time, so maybe I’m a little tired.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I see.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ok... I guess.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“See you later.”[%p]
Moeka went back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
...That was a surprise. I’d never seen Moeka talk so much before.[%p]
I’d never seen her talk that much in any linea di universo, actually.[%p]
And what’s more, she’d been able to read Maho’s expression, and even worry about her.[%p]
Maybe living with Maho was having an effect on her.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sorry, Okabe-san. Forget what I just said.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh? Ok, sure.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thanks for listening.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Any time, I guess.”[%p]
Maho smiled a little and left the room.[%p]
