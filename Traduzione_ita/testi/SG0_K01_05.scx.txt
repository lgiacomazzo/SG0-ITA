[name]Mayuri[line]“A long time ago, the air wasn’t dirty like it is now, so nobody cared if they got wet in the rain.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When Mamma was your age, Kagari-chan, she loved the rain.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She ran around outside with Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When you run in the rain, it’s like you’re swimming in the sea.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin e la Mamma erano pesci che nuotavano nel mare. Gli unici due pesci al mondo.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It was so much fun...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]When was that?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]After I’d been separated from Big Sis Suzuha in 1998, I was locked somewhere for a long time.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]When did I escape?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line][margin top="38"]Why did I escape...?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I wanted to see Mamma all of a sudden. That was the only reason.[%e]
At the place where she was kept, Kagari was waiting for the professor to come like always when she happened to look outside and see that it was raining.[%e]
When she smelled the water through the window, she remembered what her mom had said.[%p]
And the next thing she knew, she’d taken off the headset she was wearing.[%p]
Nobody had expected it, so escaping was easy.[%p]
She ripped off the cords on her arms and used the little window to go outside.[%p]
And then she’d snuck in the back of a truck that was just leaving the parking lot.[%e]
The facility she’d been kept in must have been deep within the mountains. After hours of shaking, the truck finally reached a town somewhere.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
When the truck stopped, she jumped out and wandered in the rain, with nowhere to go.[%p]
She didn’t have any destination in mind. She wanted to see her mom, but didn’t know where she was.[%p]
And even if she did find her, her mom would’ve been younger than Kagari, and wouldn’t know who she was.[%p]
She’d run away from the facility on impulse, but she had no money, and there was nothing she could do.[%p]
Except wait for the professor to come find her.[%e]
Until then—[%p]
Until then, she wanted to get wet in the rain.[%p]
The rain kept falling for a long time.[%p]
Her clothes got wet, but she didn’t care.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line](...It’s so weird that the rain doesn’t hurt.)[%p]
The rain in this era didn’t sting when it landed on your skin. It was warm.[%p]
For the first time, Kagari learned that nature could do things other than hurt you.[%p]
There was life in this rain. That’s how it felt to her.[%p]
The rain in this era was alive. It was totally different than the dead rain of the future.[%p]
Kagari kept walking, enjoying the feeling of being surrounded by living rain.[%p]
...How long had she walked?[%p]
When her legs finally started to get tired, she sat down at a bench with a roof over it.[%e]
It was a trolley platform. It was unmanned, without even a ticket station.[%p]
She sat down and looked up at the sky.[%p]
The rain was still falling.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line](I’m sure God doesn’t like this rain...)[%p]
[name]Kagari[line](He probably likes the dead rain better than the living rain.)[%p]
[name]Kagari[line](Otherwise, I can’t explain why the rain in the future is dead.)[%p]
The dead rain sure didn’t seem better than the living rain to Kagari.[%p]
But there was one thing she was sure of.[%p]
In the future, where Mom was, the rain was dead.[%p]
When she saw Mom again, the rain would be dead.[%p]
So she wasn’t really mad at God.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Boy[line]“...Are you lost?”[%p]
A boy was standing next to the bench. He was the same age as Kagari, or maybe a little younger.[%p]
He was holding an umbrella, but the area below his knees was soaking wet. He must have walked in the rain for a long time.[%p]
[margin top="76"]Kagari said nothing as he sat down next to her. He looked tired and in pain.[%e]
[name]Boy[line]“...Me too.”[%p]
The boy talked to her in a voice that was a whisper.[%p]
What he talked about, she couldn’t remember.[%p]
But he seemed to be in so much pain, as if he was carrying the weight of the whole world’s sadness on his shoulders.[%p]
Why had he talked to her when they’d never met before?[%p]
Why had he decided to open up to Kagari?[%p]
Strangely, it didn’t bother her.[%e]
She was the same.[%p]
She was the same as he was.[%p]
And strangely, she realized something.[%p]
There were things in this world that you just couldn’t change.[%p]
There were things in this world where all you could do was watch them slip through your fingers.[%p]
You couldn’t give up on them, but you had no choice but to give up.[%p]
She felt that despair.[%e]
Maybe the rain had brought the two of them together.[%p]
There were so many people in the world, and yet the two of them had no one they could talk to. So maybe the rain had brought them together.[%p]
The living rain.[%p]
The warm rain.[%p]
The gentle rain...[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin e la Mamma erano pesci che nuotavano nel mare. Gli unici due pesci al mondo.”[%p]
Mamma had looked so happy when she told that story.[%p]
But it sounded sad to Kagari.[%p]
Because the world was so big, and it was just the two of them alone.[%p]
It would be lonely and sad to have no one else there.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That’s what she’d thought.[%e]
But now she understood how Mom felt, just a little.[%p]
Just two fish, alone in the world.[%p]
But that was different than being totally alone.[%p]
No matter what else, there was someone next to you who felt the same way.[%p]
It was lonely, but she was sure it wasn’t that lonely.[%p]
That’s what she felt, at the bottom of the sea of living rain.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“C’è solo una cosa che sto cercando...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“la risata delle stelle,”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Scintillando nel vento,”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“la puoi afferrare se solo allunghi la mano.”[%p]
There was nothing Kagari could do for the boy.[%p]
But she felt like he needed that song.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
The next thing she knew, the boy was gone.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“The rain’s not stopping, huh?”[%p]
[name]Professor[line]“I’ve been looking for you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Professor[line]“Come on, let’s go.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Professor[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...I...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I have to go.”[%p]
She shook off the professor’s hand and ran off into the street, through the pouring rain.[%p]
And then she saw a truck, splashing up water from the puddles as it came barreling toward her.[%e]
