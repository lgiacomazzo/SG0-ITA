[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...I’m alive?”[%p]
Kagari woke up and realized she was in a hospital bed.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san!”[%p]
Mayuri was looking down at her with eyes swollen bright red.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Kagari-san’s awake!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Io...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You were almost hit by a truck.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You weren’t hurt, but you passed out, so we called an ambulance just in case.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t have an insurance card, so the bills are probably going to be crazy...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It doesn’t matter. It was the only thing we could do.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m just glad you’re safe, Kagari-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin saved you at the last second.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii thought you were both dead. Mayushii thought... Mayushii thought...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sob...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t cry, Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, that’s right.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I kind of remember... Okabe-san jumped out to save me.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry. I don’t know what was wrong with me. Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’m just glad you’re safe.”[%p]
In a fit of emotion, Mayuri leapt on Kagari.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m so glad, Kagari-san!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I was really worried!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mayuri-san...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]...No, that wasn’t right.[%e]
Kagari finally understood everything.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]That wasn’t right.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]This wasn’t “Mayuri-san.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]...Yes. That’s right.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]This was “Mamma.”[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“I finally...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I finally get to meet you!”[%p]
Now it was Kagari’s turn to give Mayuri a big hug.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hyah?!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? M-Mamma?!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san, no. Mayushii’s not your mamma!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You are! You’re Kagari’s mamma!”[%p]
She couldn’t stop herself from talking like a little girl.[%p]
The last ten years vanished, and Kagari was once again a small child.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mamma?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari! Your memories are back?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uncle... Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah, I remember it all now.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m Shiina Mayuri’s daughter. My name is Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“B-But you’re older than me, Kagari-san!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And Mayushii’s never um... had a baby or anything.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma, I’m from the future.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“In the future, you adopted me when I was an orphan.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii did?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s right. You were the one who gave me a reason to live.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You sent me to the safest place you could think of, so that I wouldn’t be in danger.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The safest place?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The past.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You probably thought that if I lived in a time when Japan was at peace, I could be safe.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But I still missed you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I couldn’t find you here.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No matter how safe it is, I didn’t want to live without you!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I missed you!”[%p]
Kagari clung to Mayuri on the soft bed and cried for a long time.[%p]
At first, Mayuri was confused, but she eventually hugged her back, gently.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sorry!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wah... ahh...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Waah!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mi dispiace.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It must’ve been so hard. You must’ve been so lonely.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You were sad for so long because of me, weren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mi dispiace.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma!”[%p]
