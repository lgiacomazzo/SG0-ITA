[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, Dad? Any luck?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nope, sorry. Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ho capito...”[%p]
The search for Mayuri’s future daughter, Shiina Kagari, was taking longer than expected.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me ask you something. Did you go to the police?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah. I did. But there’s no official missing person’s report.”[%p]
I was right. In order to submit a missing person’s report, you needed to have ID to prove who you were. That’s why Suzuha hadn’t done it.[%p]
And also, I later learned that the only people who could submit a search request were people like family and significant others, who were close to the missing person.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yesterday, I did some light hacking of the police database, but I didn’t find anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah, I’m sure.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Did you look too, then?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t look at any internal data like you did, Daru, but yeah.”[%p]
There was a database of missing persons on the police homepage.[%p]
But it didn’t go back very far, and it didn’t have a lot of information.[%p]
All it had was age, sex, clothes, and sometimes possessions they were carrying.[%p]
Since we knew nothing about Shiina Kagari, we had basically nothing to go on.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You know, this world may seem peaceful, but there sure are a lot of people who go missing.”[%p]
I’d thought the same thing.[%p]
Each year over a hundred unidentified bodies were found in Tokyo alone.[%p]
If you expanded that to cover all of Japan, then went back twelve years, you’d have a pretty big number.[%p]
And the number of missing persons was far greater. Each year, almost 100,000 people went missing.[%p]
And one out of every five was in their teens.[%p]
Of course, most of them just ran away from home, and 70% were found within a week after a report was filed.[%p]
But if 70% of them were found in the first week, that meant that 30% of them weren’t.[%p]
In fact, five percent of them were never found at all, and no one ever knew if they were alive or dead.[%p]
Perhaps Shiina Kagari was caught up in an accident or killed, or perhaps—[%p]
I sat up, then got off the sofa.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm? Okarin, where are you going?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought I’d do a little more research.”[%p]
School would be on break soon, anyway, and it wasn’t like I had anything to do.[%p]
And while I hadn’t been very interested at first, at some point I’d become really interested in the whereabouts of Shiina Kagari.[%p]
And more than anything...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thank you, Uncle Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s nothing, really.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No... Thank you, anyway.”[%p]
As long as I was looking for Kagari, Suzuha probably wasn’t going to bother me about the future.[%p]
Having her bring up the same thing every time we met was hard for me.[%p]
If I could get her focused on something else, that would make things easier.[%p]
Or so I’d thought, but...[%p]
Finding clues wasn’t easy.[%p]
Just in case, I’d gone to the [color index="280AA02D1400"]Biblioteca della Dieta Nazionale[color index="800000"] and looked at articles on missing persons and crimes in 1998, the year she’d gotten separated from Suzuha. But I’d had no luck.[%p]
Suzuha said she had been looking for Kagari every few years on her way to our time, so I knew it wouldn’t be easy.[%p]
But I couldn’t help but feel a little tired and disappointed.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Cosa c’è che non va?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Cosa?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Niente...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...?”[%p]
I’d called [Kurisu] without even realizing it, somehow.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hey, you seem even more tired than yesterday. You ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that how I look?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Your tone’s dropped lower than usual. I see your conjunctiva are slightly swollen with blood, too. Were you looking into that case you told me about yesterday?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
I told [Kurisu] what I’d heard from Suzuha and Daru, and what I’d found at the Biblioteca della Dieta Nazionale.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You dummy. If that’s what you were trying to do, you could’ve just asked me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Che vuoi dire?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I can access the network and research anything that’s on the internet, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, that’s right.”[%p]
I’d forgotten.[%p]
She was an AI that existed inside a computer...[%p]
So something like that would be easy for her.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Want me to give it a try?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you do it right now?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“It won’t take much time at all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right, give it a go.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Sure, just give me a second.”[%p]
[Kurisu] fell silent on the screen and didn’t move for a moment.[%p]
Maybe 30 seconds later—[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hmm.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re done already?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I searched the network, and nobody named Shiina Kagari’s been involved in any accidents or crimes since 1998.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I found three people with identical names, but given their ages, they’re almost certainly not the girl you’re looking for.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“If you want, I can send you an email with their data later.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s fine.”[%p]
When I stopped to think about it, even Suzuha would’ve been able to do a search for her name on the internet.[%p]
And what [Kurisu] was saying was almost certainly right.[%p]
The Makise Kurisu I had known was always right.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I think that’s all I can do, then. Now it’s up to you to do what only you can do.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What can I do?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Go gather information around the place where she disappeared. It’s the ultimate in analog methods, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I guess you’re right.”[%p]
Suzuha had been doing that forever, so I couldn’t imagine I’d find anything new.[%p]
But if that was my only option, then that was what I had to do.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“NyaNya? Kyo—I mean, Okarin?”[%p]
I spun around when I heard a voice behind me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I knew it was you, nya. What are you doing here, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris, and...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Hello, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh, it’s rare to see you two together.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We just happened to run into each other over there, nya. And Luka-nyan was carrying a heavy load, so I decided to help him, nya.”[%p]
I took a closer look and saw that Lukako was holding bags in both hands.[%p]
If you added in what Faris was carrying, it was quite a lot.[%p]
He was trying to carry this all alone?[%p]
Lukako?[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hey, excuse me.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Hmm? Did you just hear something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, this isn’t—”[%p]
I quickly hid the smartphone behind my back.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hey, are you listening? Hey!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“There it is again, nya! Is that who you were talking to a minute ago, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, this is—”[%p]
It shouldn’t matter if they found out.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Ehi, aspetta—”[%p]
But I still felt guilty, so I closed the Amadeus app.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Were you on the phone, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“O-Oh, I was asking an acquaintance for some advice.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Advice?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So that was it, nya. When I saw you from behind, it looked like you were mumbling to yourself. So I was a little worried, nya.”[%p]
Did I look like she needed to worry about me?[%p]
But, well... if she saw me talking to my smartphone in a place like this, I guess I could understand that.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Comunque, se sei nei guai, saresti dovuto venire da Faris, nya!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“P-Proprio così. Potrei non essere in grado di aiutarti, ma almeno posso ascoltare...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks, really. But it’s nothing...”[%p]
No, wait a second.[%p]
Both Faris and Lukako had lived in Akihabara since they were born.[%p]
And both of their families held important positions here.[%p]
Maybe asking them wouldn’t be such a bad idea after all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m actually looking for someone.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You’re looking for someone?”[%p]
I told them that I was looking for a girl who’d gone missing twelve years ago in Akihabara.[%p]
Of course, I didn’t tell them that she was from the future, or that she was Mayuri’s daughter.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’d be really interested in knowing why she went missing, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, but I can’t tell you that.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hnnya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you could ask if anyone has any idea, that would be a huge help.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hmm, got it. I’ll ask Kuroki, nya.”[%p]
Kuroki-san was her family butler.[%p]
I’d met him several times.[%p]
In the same way that Faris naturally looked like a maid, Kuroki-san just naturally looked like a butler.[%p]
Come to think of it, it was rather strange for a maid to have a butler for a servant.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh, and I’ll ask the masters at MayQueen+Nyan², nya.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ll ask my father, as well as our parishioners.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks, that would be a big help.”[%p]
Both Kuroki-san and Lukako’s dad knew a lot of people, and they had a far better chance of finding someone than we did.[%p]
I hoped they could at least find some small clue.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, Lukako. What’s all this stuff?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, remember how I said I had guests coming yesterday?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“One of those guests is going to be staying at our house for a while.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So he’d gone to get the things they needed, nya.”[%p]
If they were a guest of Lukako’s father, they must be fairly old.[%p]
And from what I’d heard yesterday, they probably had some... unique hobbies.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s rough.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No, it’s actually kind of fun.”[%p]
Fun...?[%p]
Lukako shared the same blood as his dad, so perhaps he had some latent interest in those hobbies...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t get too into it, ok?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Huh? Ok...”[%p]
I gave him that warning, then went to leave.[%p]
—Well, I tried to leave, but...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve got it... I’ve got it...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Luka-nyan, you ok? You’re not even walking straight, nya.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-I’m fine. This is nothing...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... have some tea, if you like.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’ll pass. You’ve got guests, right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s true, but...”[%p]
I couldn’t bear to see him struggle like that, so I’d carried his bags to the shrine with him.[%p]
Faris had gone back to her café.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know, I have no idea how you expected to carry all this stuff.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve gotten a little stronger lately! I’ve been doing the sword exercises you gave me, Kyo—I mean, Okabe-san...”[%p]
Sword exercises...[%p]
That was the training I’d given him when he told me he felt too much like a girl.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“[color index="280AA02D1400"]La scuola di spada Seishin Zanma[color index="800000"], huh?”[%p]
It was so stupid, I couldn’t even laugh.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
Thinking back, I was amazed he put up with that nonsense.[%p]
[name]Padre di Luka[line]“Luka, are you home?”[%p]
I could hear his dad’s voice from their home behind the shrine office.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes! I’ll be right there!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok, ora vado.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“R-Right! Thank you, Okabe-san.”[%p]
Lukako bowed deeply as I left Tempio Yanabayashi.[%p]
On my way home, I thought about what the two of them had said.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Comunque, se sei nei guai, saresti dovuto venire da Faris, nya!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“P-Proprio così. Potrei non essere in grado di aiutarti, ma almeno posso ascoltare...”[%p]
I didn’t realize until after they’d spoken...[%p]
I had gone to [Kurisu] before I’d gone to anyone else.[%p]
I’d brought up the app and started talking with her before I even realized it.[%p]
She wasn’t the real Kurisu.[%p]
But that voice, the way she acted...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
All of it reminded me of Kurisu.[%p]
All of it brought back the emotions I’d tried to hide.[%p]
There was an incoming call on my phone.[%p]
It was from [Kurisu].[%p]
She was probably there to complain about me hanging up on her earlier.[%p]
That would be just like [Kurisu].[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
But I didn’t answer the phone.[%p]
I didn’t answer any of the other calls that came that day, either.[%p]
