[name]Kagari[line]And that’s how I, Shiina Kagari, got all my memories back.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]The next several months were wonderful.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]Every day I would come to the lab and play with Mamma and her friends.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]They were all wonderful people. There was never a moment where something fun wasn’t happening.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]Mamma especially tried to spend as much time with me as possible.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]We’d eat together,[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]go shopping together,[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]or sometimes just walk around with no goal in mind.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line][margin top="38"]That normal life was everything I’d ever wanted.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]The “voice” I’d heard before began to vanish as I spent more time with her.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]Mamma always smiled.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And she always seemed so happy to hear what I had to say.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I was so happy.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]We had a lot of sleepovers, too. At the lab, at Mamma’s house, at Luka-kun’s house...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]We’d stay up late eating snacks and talking, and then I’d sleep in the same futon as Mamma.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]We’d both whisper that song.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]That song that she told me brought us together.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And it did.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]When I was little, Mamma taught me this song.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And she learned it from Big Sis Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And Big Sis Suzuha learned it from Yuki-san.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And Yuki-san learned it from Uncle Okarin’s mom.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And Uncle Okarin’s mom learned it from Uncle Okarin.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And he—[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I didn’t know for sure.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]But if that was true, it was wonderful.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I talked about a lot more with Mamma.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]About school, about the lab, about Uncle Okarin, about the future, about love... about all kinds of things.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]One day, she said this to me.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Kagari-chan.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii had an idea.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe this song is a song to make the person you love feel better.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They lost their most important treasure, and they got so sad they finally just went to sleep.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No matter how much you shake them, they won’t wake up. That’s how sad they are.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But that treasure isn’t really gone.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s actually so close they could reach out and touch it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But they don’t realize it’s so close. All they do is sleep.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But really, you know, they’re waiting for someone to wake them up.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Because that person is right next to them.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They’re not gone at all.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t know when, but I know that someday, they’ll wake up.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s what I think that song is.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]And Mamma looked at me and smiled.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]Her eyes seemed so clear and calm as she gazed at the moonlight coming in through the curtains.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]It was the first time I’d seen such a pretty color.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line][linebreak][margin top="38"]But when I thought back,[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I’d actually seen it once before.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]That day—[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]That rainy day, when I got my memories back,[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]she had that same look in her eyes when she held me.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]She’d kept saying the same thing.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“‘I’m sorry.’”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“‘I’m sorry, Kagari-chan.’”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I thought that she was apologizing for what she’d done in the future.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I thought that she was apologizing for leaving me all alone.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]But she wasn’t.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]That apology was only from the Shiina Mayuri who lived in 2011.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]She was saying that she was sorry for leaving me alone.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line][linebreak][margin top="38"]It was about half a year later when I realized this.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]July 7th, 2011.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]The day of Tanabata.[%e]
