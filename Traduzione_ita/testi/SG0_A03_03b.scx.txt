Shiina Kagari felt happier and more fulfilled than the people around her thought she was.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Her memories were missing.[%p]
[margin top="38"]All she had now were memories of when she was young.[%p]
She’d gone to the past when she was ten, and then gotten separated from Suzuha.[%p]
Her memories afterward were a total blank, with the exception of the last few weeks.[%e]
Her oldest memories, after her childhood, were of the ceiling she saw when she woke up.[%p]
It was the ceiling of an old temple, with stains here and there that looked like faces. She remembered being a little scared.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Shortly after that, she was given to Tempio Yanabayashi.[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“Kagari-san, would you like some tea?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, yeah. Thanks, Luka-kun.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ok, I’ll put some on.”[%p]
That was when she’d met Urushibara Luka.[%p]
At the time, she hadn’t realized that she already knew him.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Urushibara Luka was a good friend of her adopted mother, Shiina Mayuri.[%p]
He’d played with her a lot when they were kids.[%e]
When she was younger, she’d always thought he was a woman.[%p]
To Kagari’s young eyes, he’d been a strong, grown-up woman.[%p]
[margin top="38"]At the time, she’d always wondered why Suzuha had called him “Big Brother Luka.”[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“Here you are.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Grazie.”[%p]
But the Luka in front of her now was far younger than the one she had known. He looked like a very pretty girl.[%p]
And not nearly as strong.[%p]
[margin top="38"]So she’d only realized that he was the Urushibara Luka she knew after meeting her mother.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm... this tea tastes a little different.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s rosemary tea. It’s supposed to help you concentrate and improve your memory. I had Faris-san give me some.”[%p]
Improving your memory and finding lost memories seemed like totally different things to her, but she didn’t say so.[%p]
Just the thought made her very happy.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Luka, Mamma Mayuri, and the rest of Okabe’s friends were all trying to help her get memories back.[%p]
It would probably make most people nervous, not having their memories.[%e]
It would be hard, not knowing what you’d experienced.[%p]
But Ad essere onesti, Kagari didn’t think she needed to remember.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Sometimes it seemed like a memory was about to come back.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Each time, her mind would roar with a sense of fear and anxiety.[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“Was it not very good?”[%p]
Luka saw that she’d only taken a sip and stopped, and he seemed worried.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, no. That’s not true. It’s good.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I was just thinking.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thinking?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yup! But it’s nothing.”[%p]
She took a sip of the tea, hoping to change the subject.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Anyway, Luka-kun, are you really a boy?”[%p]
Everyone else said he was.[%p]
But still, it just didn’t seem right to her.[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“I am... Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm... You really look more like a girl, though.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t know what to say to that.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I know! Hey, why don’t we take a bath tomorrow?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Then I’ll know if you’re really a boy or not!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-No! We can’t!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why not?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“B-Because... I can’t take a bath with a girl...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Didn’t you take baths with your sister?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes, but that’s when I was little...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Heh... haha... hahahaha!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“K-Kagari...san?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sorry, sorry. It was a joke. You’re so cute I felt like I had to tease you.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Aw...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But if you responded that way, it means you really are a boy.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s what I’ve been saying.”[%p]
Even when he was upset, he still looked like a girl, she thought.[%e]
[name]Reporter[line]“As you can see, there are dozens of different dishes available, and they’re all-you-can eat!”[%p]
The TV screen had been showing all kinds of delicious food.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow...”[%p]
The sight of it almost moved her to tears.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“This time is so wonderful. It’s so different than the world I know.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Is it? What’s the future like?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Do you want to know?”[%p]
Luka looked a little uncertain.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And even though she’d asked, Kagari wasn’t certain she should tell him.[%p]
The future she knew was filled with despair.[%p]
Everyone struggled desperately to stay alive, hoping that tomorrow would somehow be better.[%p]
[margin top="38"]If they knew there was no hope, how would they survive?[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t think I do.”[%p]
Kagari sighed in relief.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“You’re better off that way. The future can be changed.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The future can be changed?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah, that’s what Mamma said. She said it could be changed. She said he’d change it.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“He’d change it...”[%p]
That’s what Mayuri had always told Kagari.[%p]
That was her tiny light of hope.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm... What was it...? Steins... what?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Steins Gate?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yes, that’s it! Mamma said she knew it was real.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But I don’t really know what it is. Ehehe...”[%p]
Steins Gate—Ad essere onesti, Kagari didn’t know exactly what that meant.[%p]
But each time Mayuri said it, Kagari had felt warmth in her heart.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Someone would come to lead them to Steins Gate. When she thought about that, it gave her hope.[%e]
[name]Newscaster[line]“And now, for our next report.”[%p]
[name]Newscaster[line]“Did you know that memory restoration technology is being studied around the globe?”[%p]
[name]Newscaster[line]“Today we have a special report on an American university that’s at the cutting edge of this research.”[%p]
The news show had finished its food report and had already switched to another topic.[%p]
Now it was showing a college campus covered in greenery.[%p]
It was a wide-open space that clearly wasn’t Japanese.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
The second she saw it, she suddenly felt dizzy.[%e]
[name]Reporter[line]“This is Università Viktor Chondria. It may seem like just another college campus.”[%p]
[name]Reporter[line]“But there’s a major project going on here right now.”[%p]
The discussion became more technical.[%p]
It was far beyond what Kagari, who had only her memories as a child, could understand.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Però—[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“Should I change the channel?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, wait.”[%p]
Kagari stopped him before he could get to the remote.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kagari-san, do you understand this?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah, they’re talking about how the brain works, and whether you could make false memories.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Wow, that’s amazing. It was too complicated for me.”[%p]
She suddenly found herself easily understanding what was being said.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Why?[%p]
[margin top="38"]How?[%p]
[margin top="38"]How could she understand this?[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah? It’s not that complicated.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Memories are controlled by a part of the brain known as the ‘hippocampus,’ and there’s a special region of the hippocampus called the ‘[color index="280AA02D1400"]giro dentato[color index="800000"].’”[%p]
She was surprised at what she was saying, but the words kept coming anyway.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“When new nerve cells are constructed there, they cause existing neurological pathways to reorganize. That’s what makes you forget things.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And so when this study team did experiments on mice, they saw false memories created.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, look. That room in the back. That’s where they do the mice experiments and stuff.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, Kagari-san, are you familiar with this university?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh?”[%p]
She suddenly realized that Luka was looking confused.[%e]
[name]Luka[line]“I mean... You seemed to know a lot about it.”[%p]
The TV was showing something that looked like a lab.[%p]
The camera went toward the back of the room. A white door opened that lead to the next room.[%e]
[name]Director[line]“After seeing the results of the experiments on mice performed here, the research team—”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...No, I don’t.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But just now...”[%p]
That’s right. She wasn’t familiar with it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She didn’t know anything about any place like this.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Però—[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t know... I don’t know... But...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“For some reason, it suddenly feels like I do.”[%p]
There was suddenly a piercing pain in the back of her head.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It felt like the beginning of something terrifying. She suddenly felt very nervous.[%e]
