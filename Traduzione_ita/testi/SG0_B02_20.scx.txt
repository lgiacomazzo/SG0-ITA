Her head hurt.[%e]
Maho knelt down, closed her eyes, and bit her lips to shut out the pain.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There was an annoying noise in her head that wouldn’t go away.[%p]
It made the headache worse.[%e]
No matter how much she covered her ears, she couldn’t block it out.[%p]
She wanted to scream from the pain, but she held it in because she thought it would only make her headache worse.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She could hear a voice mixed in with the noise.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was dottor Leskinen’s.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Listen, Maho. You need to find out Lintahlo Okabe’s secret, no matter what it takes.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“If you can’t, I’ll have to kill him. You don’t want that, right?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Mi sembrava che Lintahlo ti piacesse molto, non è così?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Me and [Kurisu] kept bringing it up, after all. Even if you weren’t interested in him originally, you couldn’t help but think about him. That’s how the human mind works.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“And to save him, I want you to find out what he knows.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“If you do that, I’m willing to bring him to my lab, unconditionally.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Maho, tell me everything you learn from him.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Diciamo che il suo futuro è nelle tue mani.”[%p]
The voice and the noise were extremely unpleasant.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She couldn’t really understand what the voice was saying.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She could hear him speaking, but her brain refused to understand the meaning of the words.[%e]
But it didn’t matter either way.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho had done something terrible to Okabe Rintaro.[%e]
She’d sold him out to dottor Leskinen and Stratfo.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And the fact that she knew it just made her guilt worse.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She wanted to disappear from the world altogether—[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maho-san...?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She was on a busy street in Akihabara in early summer.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She was leaning on the side of a building in the shade when she heard someone call her name.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I knew it was you, Maho-san.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Mayuri...san?”[%p]
She didn’t expect to see Mayuri here, so she didn’t know how to respond. She just looked back and stared.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you not feeling well?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m fine.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Have you seen Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Maho went completely still.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Mayuri’s innocent question reminded her of her own stupidity and cowardice.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Perché...”[%p]
Her voice was shaking.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I haven’t been able to get a hold of Okarin since yesterday.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He hasn’t gone home, he hasn’t picked up the phone, and he’s not answering le email or RINE.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun says I’m worrying too much, but something doesn’t feel right...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I left school early today and now I’m searching around here.”[%p]
It was still only July, but it was pretty hot.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She’d been wandering around all of Akihabara in this heat?[%e]
Shiina Mayuri was a kind, pure-hearted girl. That was the impression that Maho had.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She would never betray someone, or get jealous, or let someone manipulate her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Do you want to know...?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Mayuri leaned forward.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maho-san, do you know where Okarin is?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you know, please tell me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Per favore.”[%p]
She bowed deeply.[%e]
[name]Maho[line](I see...)[%p]
And then she realized. And then she wished she hadn’t.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Mayuri was in love with Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[margin top="38"]A dull pain ran down her temples.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Mi sembrava che Lintahlo ti piacesse molto, non è così?”[%p]
She could hear the noise in her head.[%e]
-Just tell Mayuri everything.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—And then have this innocent girl tell you how horrible you are.[%p]
[margin top="38"]—Maybe you’ll feel better then.[%e]
The idea raced through Maho’s mind.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Even as she knew it was wrong.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She tried to hold back her headache as she opened her mouth.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“—I was with Okabe-san, late last night.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Were you...? So where is he now?”[%p]
Maho ignored her question.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...This is what he told me last night.”[%p]
—No.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“He told me about another world he’d experienced, where you, Shiina Mayuri-san, had died again and again.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...?”[%p]
—Don’t tell her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“No matter what he did, he couldn’t save you.”[%p]
—You can’t tell her this.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“To escape that nightmarish loop—”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“To save you—”[%p]
It was like another person was speaking using Maho’s mouth.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san sacrificed Kurisu. He let her die.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s what he told me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If he makes a time machine and tries to save Kurisu again, he’ll go back to all that.”[%p]
—You’re hurting her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But the words didn’t stop.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san is so afraid of that.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“He’s doing everything he can to protect you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“This is the world he chose, after sacrificing many things to protect you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m sure he didn’t tell you any of that, though.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s not true...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
Mayuri was too shocked to speak.[%p]
She looked like she was about to cry at any instant.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri turned around and started to walk away with slumped shoulders.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Even from behind her, Maho could tell she was having trouble walking straight.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The truth was so cruel that confronting it threatened her very identity. That’s how it seemed to Maho.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho was still in a trance.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It felt like there was a fog covering everything she saw.[%e]
It was all out of focus, like a mirage.[%p]
[margin top="38"]If someone told her it was a dream, she would easily believe it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The same was true of her own mind.[%e]
She knew she should feel worse about what she just told Mayuri, but while she realized she’d hurt her, she felt no emotion.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That was probably why she was able to say something so awful.[%e]
And then the phone in her pocket began to vibrate.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She looked and saw it was from Amadeus—from [Kurisu].[%p]
[margin top="38"]She felt a small, thin needle prick her paralyzed heart.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She couldn’t answer it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]How could she?[%p]
[margin top="38"]She stared at the LCD screen, unable to move her fingers even a centimeter.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“How could I answer it?”[%p]
She couldn’t let [Kurisu] see her like this.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But even so, it felt wrong to just stay here.[%e]
Maho decided to go after Mayuri.[%e]
But by the time she made it to the overpass, Mayuri was already gone.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Since she was right in front of the station, there were many people around, and it would’ve been impossible to find her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Why did you come up to me?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If you hadn’t talked to me, you wouldn’t have had to suffer.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m not who I used to be.”[%p]
She looked down over the station from the overpass and whispered to herself.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And then she saw someone in a distinctive outfit approaching her.[%e]
They were wearing a black motorcycle suit and black full-face helmet despite the heat.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She thought it might have been a cosplayer, but instead of trying to take pictures, the people nearby were avoiding them.[%e]
Given a closer look, the person appeared to be a woman.[%p]
Even Maho could tell that she had incredible proportions.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The woman walked under the overpass and vanished from Maho’s view.[%e]
—And then she came up the stairs.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And she came right toward Maho.[%e]
Maho quickly looked away, like the other pedestrians, and tried to run away.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But before she could, the woman in the motorcycle suit ran over and wordlessly grabbed her hand.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“!”[%p]
There was a pain in her cheek.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She was caught off guard and staggered to the ground.[%e]
At first, she didn’t know what had happened.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She rubbed her aching cheek, and only then did she realize that the woman in the motorcycle suit had slapped her.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“You hurt Mamma, didn’t you?”[%p]
She could hear a muffled female voice from within the helmet.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“I’ll kill you.”[%p]
Her voice was very calm, which only terrified Maho more.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“The professor told me about you... but it doesn’t matter.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Who are you?”[%p]
Because she was wearing a helmet, Maho couldn’t read her facial expression. Since the visor was lowered, she couldn’t even see her eyes.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“...”[%p]
There was no answer to her question.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Instead, the woman looked up to the sky, as if she’d noticed something.[%e]
Maho looked up, too.[%p]
[margin top="38"]For a moment, it seemed as if a black shadow crossed the windows of the building.[%e]
She could hear a helicopter. It was close.[%p]
How long had it been there?[%p]
She hadn’t noticed it at all.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And then she felt the air around her change.[%e]
The pedestrians were all looking toward the station in fear and shock.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She could hear people saying things like, “What’s that?” “Are they filming a TV show?” “Some kind of cosplay event?”[%e]
Something was going on at the station.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho stood up and looked, too.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...What is that?”[%p]
She found herself whispering the same thing as the others.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There were two trucks painted a deep military green parked outside the station.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Men were coming out of them, dressed in camo and carrying weapons.[%e]
At first, she thought it might have been the Forze di Autodifesa, but the men weren’t Japanese.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was hard to believe that what she was seeing was taking place in Japan.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The men in camo disappeared into the alleyways as everyone watched from a safe distance.[%p]
They were heading toward Radi-Kan. Maho had heard from Rintaro yesterday that the time machine was there.[%e]
[name]Maho[line](Was that Stratfo?)[%p]
Or Russia? Or perhaps another country’s military?[%p]
[margin top="38"]Were they here because Maho had told Leskinen what she’d learned from Rintaro?[%p]
[margin top="38"]As soon as the thought crossed her mind, she was hit with another terrible headache.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
It was all her fault.[%p]
Everything was her fault.[%e]
Until a moment ago, everything had seemed so hazy.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But now she felt crushed by overwhelming guilt.[%e]
If Okabe was right, and the Terza Guerra Mondiale was going to begin here in Akihabara, it would be because she gave the information he shared with her to Stratfo.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She suddenly realized that the girl who’d threatened to kill her had run down the stairs and toward the station.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho never did figure out who she was.[%e]
And then her phone started to vibrate again.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was from [Kurisu].[%e]
She wanted to get away from the guilt.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And so this time, she picked up the phone.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Senpai!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu]...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...Stai bene?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Che intendi?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What happened to you?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Niente.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“But... you’re crying.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
Only then did she realize that her eyes were overflowing with tears.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The fog over her mind was now totally gone, and all that was left was the guilt, the regret, and the headaches.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“My head hurts...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Diciamo che il suo futuro è nelle tue mani.”[%p]
She heard the noise again.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Where’s Okabe? What happened to him?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Who cares about Okabe-san?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You tried to kill him! I saw it!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Leave me alone...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I can’t do that.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Just leave me alone!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I couldn’t beat you...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t be better than you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You know, Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I respect you. You’re younger than me, but I think you’re an incredible scientist.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But at the bottom of my heart, this is what I used to think...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Why did you have to show up?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Why didn’t you come ten years before?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Why didn’t you come ten years later?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If it weren’t for you, I would’ve had a more peaceful life...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Then these awful feelings wouldn’t take control of me...!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Everything I thought I knew, you destroyed!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And even though you’re dead, you’re still with me!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I want to just be sorry that you’re gone, but I can’t.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re still this wall that I can’t overcome...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And my pride and stubbornness get in the way.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And the man I trusted the most took advantage of that to betray me... and I betrayed a friend who trusted me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t even think straight anymore...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So leave me alone.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Senpai...”[%p]
She was getting far too emotional. Normally she’d never behave like this, but she couldn’t stop herself.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
She heard an explosion in the distance.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The people around her started to scream, panic, and run.[%e]
The flames from the explosions were coming from the direction the men in camo had gone.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Did they do it?[%e]
The helicopter sounds were getting louder.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Glimpses of their dark, agile bodies had flashed in and out of Maho’s vision for a little while now.[%e]
And then she started to hear loud gunfire.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was more than one or two people shooting. There was a battle going on between many people, taking place here in front of Akihabara Station.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was like the beginning of a war.[%e]
If what Rintaro said was true, Amane Suzuha might be near the time machine. And she might be caught up in the battle.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She wondered about the woman in the motorcycle suit, too.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She started to stagger forward. She still didn’t know what she was planning, but she needed to take responsibility for what she’d done.[%e]
The elevators in Radi-Kan were broken.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho had no choice but to take the stairs to the roof.[%e]
But maybe the power had been cut, because the lights were off on every floor.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She could hear sporadic sounds of gunfire from the floors above.[%e]
Strangely, nobody came running past her to escape.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There were several shops in the building, and of course, there should have been customers there.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But despite that, since the elevators weren’t working...[%e]
Had they all evacuated earlier, or were they all hiding somewhere and waiting for the terror to end?[%p]
[margin top="38"]That was what she thought about as she sweated her way up the stairs.[%e]
Just before she reached the roof, she saw someone for the first time.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Sob... sob... Mamma... Mamma’s...”[%p]
She was sitting on the stairs, cradling her knees.[%p]
[margin top="38"]For some reason, her voice was muffled, but it did seem to be a woman’s voice.[%e]
Her head seemed big and round in the darkness. It was a moment before she realized that it was a full-face helmet.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That was when she realized it was the woman in the motorcycle suit from before.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Sob... Mamma...”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Where are you, Mamma...?”[%p]
She seemed like a totally different person than the woman she’d met before.[%p]
All she did was sob and cry for her mother.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Hey, what’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Mamma... Where are you? Mamma...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Tell me!”[%p]
She shouted louder, and only then did the woman realize she was there.[%p]
But she didn’t even stand up.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Mamma’s... gone...”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“The time machine was destroyed...”[%p]
The time machine was... destroyed...[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Who’s your Mamma?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Is it Amane Suzuha-san?”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“It’s Mamma Mayuri, of course...”[%p]
Maho’s blood ran cold when she heard the name “Mayuri.”[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Mayuri-san’s... here?”[%p]
If that was true, she would’ve come here after she learned the truth from Maho.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s my fault...”[%p]
Maho put her hands to her head.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“If I hadn’t said that... Mayuri-san wouldn’t have...”[%p]
The woman in the motorcycle suit stood up and approached her menacingly.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“That’s right. You got the information out of Okabe Rintaro... and that’s what began all of this...”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Give me back my Mamma!”[%p]
The girl grabbed her by the collar and lifted her off the ground.[%p]
[margin top="38"]There wasn’t anything she could say.[%e]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Sob... sob... Mamma...”[%p]
When she didn’t answer, the woman let go and fell to the ground, crying.[%p]
[margin top="38"](—Things would be so much easier if she just killed me here.)[%e]
Her mind was in such chaos that she couldn’t stop herself from thinking it.[%p]
She couldn’t stay calm at all.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And the last thing she clung to was...[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu]...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Senpai...”[%p]
...the AI made from Makise Kurisu’s memory data.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maybe she was still thinking about their last discussion, because she seemed upset.[%p]
She wasn’t saying anything.[%p]
[margin top="38"]So Maho gave up the last of her pride.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“[Kurisu]...what do I do?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Too much has happened... and there’s nothing I can do on my own anymore.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“At least... I want to take responsibility for what I’ve done.”[%p]
And then she realized that she was still being proud, and corrected herself.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I—”[%p]
She asked herself.[%p]
[margin top="38"]What do I want to do?[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I want to save Okabe-san... I want to save Mayuri-san. I want to apologize to both of them, so they’ll forgive me...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I want to save you, too.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So help me...! Please...!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You’re asking me for help?”[%p]
[Kurisu]’s eyes were wide.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That’s right. Her pride had kept her from ever asking Kurisu for help before. And it was the same with [Kurisu], too.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And knowing [Kurisu]’s personality, if Maho asked for help, she’d use every bit of brainpower she had to give it.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Come on, tell me...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You can give me some solution, right?”[%p]
That’s why they said Makise Kurisu was a genius.[%p]
She was a woman who made the impossible possible.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho waited for [Kurisu]’s answer.[%e]
The last hope. The last thing left in Vaso di Pandora.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She waited for [Kurisu] to give her the answer.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Però—[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“It’s impossible.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho was struck dumb for a moment. Then she realized how selfish she was being, and hated herself for it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She’d expected too much of [Kurisu], and tried to put all the burden on her.[%p]
And just a few moments ago, she’d been the one who rejected [Kurisu].[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah... You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Of course that’s what you’d say...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m sorry... I’m sorry, [Kurisu]...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I was so horrible to you...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“And then I stupidly thought that you’d help me unconditionally...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’ll help you unconditionally.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Cosa hai appena detto?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I can’t turn down a request for help from you.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“And I want to save Okabe and Shiina Mayuri-san, too.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But... then...?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’d love to help, but...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Unfortunately, my help would just make things worse.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’m being constantly monitored by Stratfo.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Constantly...?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Whenever I’m talking to someone like this, all the information is transferred to Stratfo.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“There’s a hidden function in the Amadeus app that does that.”[%p]
Even Maho hadn’t known that existed.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“So if you try to help Okabe, dottor Leskinen will know all about it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But... then what do I do?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“But if you’re willing to take advantage of that, there’s something we can do.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Senpai, will you trust me?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Senpai...?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sì...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re all I’ve got.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“By the way, I’m sure this conversation is being monitored as well.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Cosa?!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But then... if they know you’re helping me...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“There are three possibilities.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“They could take my data off the server and isolate me.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Or overwrite my data with an older version of my memories.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“In the worst case, they could delete me entirely.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No...!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Don’t worry.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You’re capable of standing up on your own two feet.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m not worried about me! I’m worried about you!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’m nothing but data. But thank you.”[%p]
The [Kurisu] on the screen bowed and smiled.[%e]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’m proud that I was able to work with you, Maho-senpai.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“W-What? Don’t talk like it’s the last time we’re ever going to see each other.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Well, it might be.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I hate you!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You always do this... You always go and leave me behind...!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
But that’s who Makise Kurisu was.[%p]
[margin top="38"]When Maho had asked her for help, both she and [Kurisu] should have been prepared.[%e]
That’s why—[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Someday, I’ll catch up to you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No, I’ll surpass you!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Just you wait!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
[Kurisu] smiled once more, and disappeared from the screen.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho wiped away her tears, and thwapped the crying girl next to her on the helmet.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“How long are you going to keep crying?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You want to save Mayuri-san, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So help me.”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“Help you...?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“First, we need to find Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“He should be able to show us how to get out of this.”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“But... do you know where Stratfo’s hideout is?”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“I don’t...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Neither do I.”[%p]
But Maho grabbed the girl by the hand and helped her up, then raced down the stairs.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t know... but my friend is going to find me the answer soon.”[%p]
She told me to believe in her.[%p]
[margin top="38"](Makise Kurisu wouldn’t betray me.)[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
As soon as she left Radi-Kan, she got a message on her RINE.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The gunfire was continuing. As she hurried away, she looked down at her phone.[%e]
When she read it, she smiled despite everything that was going on.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Thank you, [Kurisu]...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Grazie...”[%p]
She clutched the phone tightly to her chest.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But then she quickly changed gears.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I found the Stratfo hideout.”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“...Tell me where it is.”[%p]
[name]Donna in tuta da motociclista[line]“I’ll go there and kill everyone inside...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho shivered at the ice in her words.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She felt a bottomless madness coming from the woman in the motorcycle suit.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But for now, she had to cooperate with her.[%p]
There was no way she could get Rintaro back from Leskinen on her own.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Let’s go.”[%p]
She needed to take responsibility for the future she’d created...[%p]
To avoid that cruel future.[%e]
Maho ran through the streets of Akihabara, where a war was already beginning.[%e]
