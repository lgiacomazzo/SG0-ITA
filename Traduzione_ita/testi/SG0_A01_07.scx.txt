The Ufficio Giapponese of the Organizzazione Globale di Ricerca Comprensiva sulle Neuroscienze in Wako City, Saitama.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Hiyajo Maho had tried her best to hold back a yawn, but in the end, she’d given up and opened her mouth so wide it covered well over half her face.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Wheeew...”[%p]
One reason was that she’d gotten caught up in talking to [Kurisu] last night, and only ended the conversation after it was late into the night.[%p]
[margin top="38"]At first, they’d been discussing the research and experiments she’d been doing, but at some point she’d gotten side-tracked into talking about Okabe Rintaro.[%e]
Evidently, he’d been ignoring calls from [Kurisu] for the last few days.[%p]
Kurisu was much madder at him than she was when he’d ignored her the first eight times.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was the first sign of femininity that she’d ever seen from Makise Kurisu.[%e]
It was cute enough that Maho couldn’t help but take the chance to get back at her for all the teasing she always did. She’d ended up staying up a lot later than she’d intended.[%p]
And since she was too energized to sleep by that point, she’d gotten out Kurisu’s old laptop.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She’d started to fiddle with it to see if there was some way to crack the password, and the next thing she knew, it was morning.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“A password, huh?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Maybe it would be better to ask a professional.”[%p]
[name]???[line]“What’s up, now?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hyah?!”[%p]
She suddenly heard a voice behind her and almost jumped out of her chair.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Hahaha, is it really that surprising?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“P-Professor! You’re back?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Just now.”[%p]
He raised up his hands and showed her some plastic bags from a nearby convenience store.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He’d left to go get lunch just ten minutes ago, and she’d been sure he wouldn’t be back for a while.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“You know, Japanese convenience stores have so many foods to choose from! It’s truly wonderful!”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“You can eat a different boxed lunch every day, and a week later you’ll have new ones to choose from.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“And each store’s got its own flavor, so you can get your food from them every day if you want.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“If you keep eating boxed lunches from convenience stores, you’re going to get fat.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Hahaha! It’s still healthy compared to American food.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Also, I don’t think you have the right to lecture anyone about their eating habits.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Uh...”[%p]
He was right. Nutrition wasn’t an important consideration for Maho.[%p]
[margin top="38"]In fact, she ate mostly cereal and meal replacement shakes, which made her diet very unhealthy.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“By the way, what do you want to ask a professional for help with?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, that... It’s nothing. Nothing.”[%p]
It wouldn’t bother her if Leskinen found out.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But for some reason, she suddenly decided not to tell him.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Yeah? If there’s anything I can do to help, I will.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Thank you. I may take you up on that.”[%p]
She stood up and headed for the door.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Maho? Where are you going?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m going to Akihabara to get some fresh air.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“That’s a long way to go just for some fresh air.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Uh...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“If you just admit that you’re going to see Lintahlo, I’ll permit it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I-It’s not like that!”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“It’s not?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...I might go see him while I’m there.”[%p]
Okabe had a laboratory in Akihabara. [Kurisu] had told her that last night.[%p]
She’d said something about how he’d been avoiding it for a long time, and only recently started going there again.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho was a little interested in it, too.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“J-Just so we’re clear, it’s not like that! It really isn’t.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“I haven’t said a word.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Anyway, I’m taking the day off.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Tell Lintahlo I said hi.”[%p]
First [Kurisu], and now the professor. Why did they keep trying to make everything about romance?[%e]
[name]Maho[line](And anyway, isn’t that called sexual harassment these days?)[%p]
For one thing, she wasn’t going to Okabe’s lab just to visit him.[%p]
She wanted to see him again and see if she could get any hints about the password.[%e]
He had said he didn’t know, but he’d probably be able to come up with more than she could on her own.[%p]
[margin top="38"]That was what she’d thought after seeing how he interacted with Amadeus.[%p]
[margin top="38"]You could call it a woman’s intuition.[%e]
She was thinking about that when she changed trains and got off at Akihabara station.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...?”[%p]
She felt like someone was watching her and spun around.[%p]
It was a weekday, but the station was crowded.[%p]
She looked around at all the people, but none of them seemed to be paying her much attention.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“I must’ve imagined that... right?”[%p]
She whispered to no one in particular as she started to walk again.[%p]
[Kurisu] had told her the location of the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She wasn’t that familiar with the layout of Akihabara, but if she needed to, she could ask her for directions.[%p]
But what if she came in unannounced and Okabe wasn’t there?[%p]
That bothered her a little, but she decided she could just leave if that happened.[%e]
Her eyes lingered on the junk parts lined up in the bins at the shops as she walked, when—[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She felt someone looking at her again.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But when she turned around, she still didn’t see anyone.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
She started walking again, then went around a corner into an alley.[%e]
And then she was sure of it.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Footsteps.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She could hear them behind her.[%p]
Of course, that was nothing special.[%e]
She would often be out walking at night and hear footsteps behind her. She’d speed up her pace, only to see an irritated man walk past a moment later.[%p]
But this time, for some reason, she was sure it wasn’t that.[%p]
She decided to try walking faster, and found the footsteps went faster, too. When she went slower, so did they.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
Whenever she saw a scene like this in a movie, she imagined that she’d just kick the guy in the face. Now that it was actually happening, she was too scared to turn around.[%p]
She fumbled for the phone in her pocket.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The idea of calling the police never occurred to her.[%p]
The only thing she thought of was the name of the man she was trying to meet.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She picked it out of her call history, and pressed the button with trembling fingers.[%e]
[name]Maho[line](Please...!)[%p]
The footsteps overlapped with the sound of the ringing.[%e]
[name]Maho[line](Okabe-san! Help me...!)[%p]
The footsteps were almost on top of her.[%p]
Just when she couldn’t take it anymore, and was about to start running—[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pronto?”[%p]
She heard a voice coming from the other side of the phone.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Pronto? Okabe-san? Sono io! Hiyajo!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m right next to your lab—”[%p]
But she didn’t get to say another word.[%p]
[margin top="38"]By the time she’d realized that someone had grabbed her from behind, the phone had already slipped from her hands.[%e]
