[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Where...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
...was I?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Che cosa stavo facendo?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...”[%p]
I tried to speak, but the words didn’t come out.[%p]
It looked like I was lying on a bed.[%p]
And a very hard one, at that.[%p]
I slowly looked around.[%p]
It wasn’t the lab, and it wasn’t my room.[%p]
The room was old and gloomy.[%p]
Of course, I’d never seen it before.[%p]
What was I doing here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
There was a terrible pain in my head, like someone had jammed an electrode into my brain.[%p]
I tried to raise my hand as I lay there, but it was too heavy.[%p]
It was like all the joints in my body had frozen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah... aaah...”[%p]
It took all my strength to slowly sit up.[%p]
Each time I moved a little, my muscles screamed and pain ran through my whole body.[%p]
After several minutes, I finally succeeded in sitting on the edge of the bed and looking down. I realized I was wearing a white gown, like hospital patients wear.[%p]
There was some kind of equipment on my head, and the cables coming out of it were connected to a strange machine.[%p]
What had happened to me?[%p]
Just a moment ago, I was—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
That’s right. Kagari.[%p]
Kurisu’s memories had been downloaded into Kagari’s head.[%p]
We’d tried to erase them by overwriting them with Kagari’s own memories—[%p]
E poi...[%p]
That’s right. I remembered now.[%p]
The linea di universo had shifted right after that.[%p]
What had happened then?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I tried to remember, but it was like my mind was filled with fog.[%p]
For now, I needed to figure out where I was.[%p]
I took off the headgear, and got out of bed—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
And collapsed.[%p]
This didn’t make sense.[%p]
Was I just dizzy after all that was going on in my head?[%p]
I tried to stand up again—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Grr...!”[%p]
And I couldn’t get any strength in my legs.[%p]
I kept standing up and falling over, and in the end, I was only able to get up by grabbing the side of the bed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahh... hahh...”[%p]
How could standing on my own two feet be so exhausting?[%p]
Was I sick with some terrible disease?[%p]
And then maybe I’d been in bed for several days?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I somehow managed to drag my weak legs to the door.[%p]
It was bizarrely heavy.[%p]
Or maybe it just seemed that way to me.[%p]
It only opened after I put my full weight on it.[%p]
The door was locked, but it seemed to be the kind that could be opened from the inside.[%p]
I walked down the dark hallway, leaning up against the wall for support.[%p]
At the end of the hall were stairs.[%p]
I clung to the railing and slowly, slowly walked up them. At the end of the stairs, I found a hatch.[%p]
Using the full strength of my back, I was just barely able to get it open.[%p]
I was inside an old building.[%p]
I walked down the crumbling hallway, still clueless as to what was going on, and finally found the door to the outside.[%p]
Exhausted, I staggered outside.[%p]
And I saw—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Mountains of shattered rubble.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the heck...”[%p]
Rows of destroyed, abandoned buildings.[%p]
Exposed, twisted steel girders.[%p]
At first I thought it was a movie set.[%p]
But it was all far too realistic for that.[%p]
The walls, the windows, the ceilings... everything was destroyed. Little bits of rubble covered the ground.[%p]
There were cracks in the asphalt on the road, making it impossible to walk straight.[%p]
And it wasn’t just directly in front of me.[%p]
I spun around a full 360 degrees and saw the same scene everywhere.[%p]
I smelled oil.[%p]
I smelled something burning.[%p]
I looked up to the sky.[%p]
It was dark and gloomy.[%p]
I thought it might just be cloudy, but something else seemed to be going on.[%p]
I could see the hazy outline of the sun beyond the black curtain that covered the sky.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Cough... cough...”[%p]
A violent pain in my throat made me cough.[%p]
I quickly covered my mouth with the sleeve of my gown.[%p]
My eyes stung.[%p]
I tried once more to calm down and see if I could remember what happened, but I had no luck.[%p]
All I knew for sure was that there had been a linea di universo shift when I’d deleted Kurisu’s memories from inside Kagari.[%p]
The memories held by the Amadeus [Kurisu]...[%p]
And the memories implanted in Kagari...[%p]
Maybe when whoever owned them changed—that is, whoever held Kurisu’s time machine theory—the linea di universo changed with it.[%p]
And this was another altered linea di universo.[%p]
Which meant what I was seeing was—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I saw what looked like an ash-covered stick poking out of the ground in the corner of my eye.[%p]
I slowly went to take a closer look.[%p]
It was sticking out of the rubble, and at the tip it split into five smaller branches.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hyah—!”[%p]
Era una mano.[%p]
It was a human hand that had been scorched pitch black.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Gah... gweh... guuuhh...”[%p]
A terrible feeling came rising up out of my stomach.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—?!”[%p]
Suddenly, I thought I saw something move.[%p]
C’era qualcuno.[%p]
Dove?[%p]
I listened carefully to try and pick them out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The other side of that big building.[%p]
I could hear some kind of sound from over there.[%p]
Was someone there?[%p]
If there was, maybe they could tell me what the hell was going on.[%p]
Trying my best not to make any sound, I peeked through the walls of the crumbling building.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
They were there all right.[%p]
There were people there.[%p]
Lots of them.[%p]
But they weren’t people anymore.[%p]
They were just human-shaped wads of meat...[%p]
Piled up into a mountain.[%p]
And on top of the mountain was a pack of dogs.[%p]
Something long and slick was hanging out of the dogs’ mouths.[%p]
Intestines.[%p]
They were eating them.[%p]
They were eating the bodies.[%p]
The stench was horrible.[%p]
The sound of the flies was overwhelming.[%p]
It was like something out of hell.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah... aaah... aaah...”[%p]
My gaze met the vacant eyes of one of the bodies.[%p]
One of its eyes fell out, and black insects crawled out of the empty socket.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uwahh... AAAAHHH!”[%p]
I ran away.[%p]
I ran as fast as I could, stumbling forward on failing legs.[%p]
Somewhere—[%p]
Was there somewhere around here that was sane?[%p]
But no matter how far I went, it was the same thing.[%p]
Mountains of rubble.[%p]
Rows of abandoned buildings.[%p]
All I could see were the dead.[%p]
There were no living humans.[%p]
And then I found it.[%p]
There were rows of huge buildings, which all looked as if they were about to fall over.[%p]
The roads were full of cracks.[%p]
There was a warped overpass sticking out of the ground.[%p]
A few rows of iron and railroad ties.[%p]
Lo conoscevo.[%p]
I knew this place.[%p]
It was only a shadow of its former self, but I knew it.[%p]
This was—Akihabara.[%p]
Il che significa—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened to the lab...?”[%p]
Where was Mayuri? Where was Daru? Where was Faris?[%p]
What about Lukako? Or Suzuha?[%p]
What happened to Maho and Kagari?![%p]
Just as I ran toward the lab to find out—[%p]
I heard footsteps behind me.[%p]
Rough footsteps, stomping over the rubble. More than one set.[%p]
They got louder and louder, and soon I saw them coming toward me from between the crumbling buildings.[%p]
There were three of them.[%p]
They each had assault rifles in their hands.[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“You! What are you doing there?”[%p]
When they saw me, they all pointed their guns at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah...”[%p]
There was so much I wanted to ask them.[%p]
There were things I wanted to know.[%p]
But the only thought that came to me was that I needed to get away.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“—!”[%p]
But even as I tried to turn and run, my body refused to listen.[%p]
[name]Uomo armato[line]“Fermo!”[%p]
They must’ve sensed that I was about to flee, because one of them yelled.[%p]
Holes appeared in the concrete at my feet.[%p]
They’d shot at me.[%p]
They really shot at me.[%p]
They’d shot at me with real guns—[%p]
If I’d been just a little closer, they would’ve hit me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aah... aah...”[%p]
I was too scared to stand.[%p]
The men got closer, still holding the guns.[%p]
Run.[%p]
You have to run.[%p]
But it was like my body belonged to someone else. It wasn’t listening to me.[%p]
The men kept getting closer.[%p]
E in quel momento—[%p]
There was another sharp noise.[%p]
One of the men collapsed to the side.[%p]
He hit his head on the rubble and stopped moving.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh...?”[%p]
[name]Armed man[line]“—?!”[%p]
The other two waved their guns around, clearly confused as to what just happened.[%p]
[name]???[line]“You’re in the way!”[%p]
Something dragged me to the ground.[%p]
And then more gunshots.[%p]
The two of them fell backward, still holding their weapons, at almost the exact same time.[%p]
They’d died.[%p]
Right in front of me.[%p]
Someone had died.[%p]
I could do nothing more than sit there and watch as a silhouette moved in front of me.[%p]
[name]???[line]“Are you trying to get killed?”[%p]
I looked up.[%p]
And the person I saw was...[%p]
[name]Donna[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha—[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, how long are you just going to sit there?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you kill them?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What kind of stupid question is that?”[%p]
It was a colder voice than I’d ever heard.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re... Suzuha, right?”[%p]
Her iron mask of an expression suddenly changed to surprise.[%p]
But that was only for a moment.[%p]
A second later and the fierceness had returned.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Who are you?”[%p]
Did she really not...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t know who I am?”[%p]
Did the change in the linea di universo mean that Suzuha and I had never met?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me, Okabe. Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
The expression on her face changed again.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro? That’s... impossible.”[%p]
Two pairs of icy footsteps sounded in the darkness.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This way.”[%p]
After I’d given my name, Suzuha had stared at me suspiciously for a moment.[%p]
Then she’d made some kind of call and told me to come with her.[%p]
She made me wear a blindfold almost the entire time, though.[%p]
So I had no idea which way I’d gone or where I was.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Stop.”[%p]
I did as she said.[%p]
When I heard the knock, I finally realized we were in front of a door.[%p]
[name]Man’s voice[line]“Moe moe for you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Bakkyun-kyun.”[%p]
[name]Man’s voice[line]“Come in.”[%p]
Evidently that was the password.[%p]
I could only think of one man who’d choose such a stupid password.[%p]
I heard the sound of a heavily locked door opening, and at last I saw a dimly-lit room in the darkness.[%p]
The room was piled high with what looked like mechanical junk.[%p]
Rows of instruments lined the walls.[%p]
A man was sitting in front of them, looking straight at me.[%p]
[name]Man[line]“I’m so glad. You’re finally awake, Okarin...”[%p]
Who was this guy?[%p]
How did he know my name?[%p]
He must’ve been in his mid-forties.[%p]
He was a big, broad-shouldered man with a stubbly face.[%p]
There was a sharp but gentle light in his eyes.[%p]
I felt like I’d seen him somewhere before...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um, who are you?”[%p]
[name]Man[line]“Aw, jeez. Did you forget about me? Even after all that’s happened, that still hurts, Okarin.”[%p]
The way he talked...[%p]
And that voice...[%p]
There was only one person it could be.[%p]
But that was—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you... Daru?”[%p]
The man’s face broke into a broad smile.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Good, you did remember. I thought you’d forgotten.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru... Is it really you?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Who else do you know that’s as handsome as me? Right, Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I might admit that, if you lost a little weight.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t say that. I’ve lost a lot since I was younger.”[%p]
Indeed, the Daru in front of me was quite a bit slimmer than the Daru I knew.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And wait, Dad, why are you talking funny?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t usually talk like this. But I figured it would make things easier for Okarin.”[%p]
The more pressing issue though, was his age.[%p]
He was clearly a middle-aged man.[%p]
The youngest I could possibly imagine him to be was his early forties.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
And then I saw a shelf in the corner.[%p]
I saw a man I didn’t know reflected in its glass.[%p]
It was another man like him, in his forties.[%p]
He was staring at me with a gloomy, sunken face.[%p]
I slowly raised my right hand.[%p]
And the man raised his left as if copying me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru... Tell me something.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anything you want, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What... year is it?”[%p]
Daru’s smile quickly became something more serious as he answered me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s 2036. The world is at war.”[%p]
