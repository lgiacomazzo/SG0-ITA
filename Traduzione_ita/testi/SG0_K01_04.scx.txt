The next day, the sky had been cloudy since morning.[%p]
I met with Kagari and Mayuri at a spot near the cemetery where her grandmother was buried.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It looks like it’s going to rain, huh?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I didn’t bring an umbrella.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The weather said it wasn’t going to rain...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii didn’t, either!”[%p]
And I never brought an umbrella when it wasn’t raining.[%p]
In other words, nobody had an umbrella.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s finish this before the rain starts.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Grandma will be happy you came, I bet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Certo.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And Kagari-san’s here today, too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t wait to introduce my wonderful new friend to Grandma!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mayuri-san...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, let’s hurry! There’s a lot Mayushii wants to tell Grandma!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Let’s hurry.”[%p]
We finally arrived at the cemetery.[%p]
The skies were getting darker, and it felt like it could rain at any minute.[%p]
We finished cleaning the grave, and each of us put our hands together in front of us. Then Mayuri sat down and started talking to her grandma.[%p]
Kagari and I watched her from a short distance away.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And then Kagari-san came in, and she was so surprised, she fell down and went bang!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii was really scared, and really worried, but I had to go to work...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I said to Okarin and Daru-kun, ‘Take care of Kagari-san!’ and left the lab.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But I was so worried I thought my heart was going to burst.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okabe-san, um...”[%p]
Kagari whispered to me, concerned.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, don’t worry about Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s kind of like a ritual.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“A ritual?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. She loved her grandma a lot, and when her grandma died, it was like she lost her soul.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For about six months she wouldn’t say a word to anyone. She’d just come here and stand all day.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It was like she was praying to go be with her grandma.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And you brought her back, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-How did you know?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mayuri-san told me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That girl...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Aw, come on. It’s cool. Hououin Kyouma-san, the mad scientist...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was desperate for any idea I could think of.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looking back, it was the right answer, but it was still really embarrassing.”[%p]
I’d used every bit of knowledge I could scrape up from anime and video games to try and keep Mayuri’s soul from leaving us.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let anyone take you away.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“M-Mayuri is my hostage. She’s a sacrifice for my human experiments!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Th-There is no escaping me! Haha... Fwahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... sniff...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s your hostage...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I guess I’m stuck here, huh? Ehehe...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I think that’s a wonderful story.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It is.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Aah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It started raining.”[%p]
I looked up just in time for a drop to fall on my cheek.[%p]
A cold rain started to come down.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I didn’t think it would start so soon. What should we do?”[%p]
We’d just gotten here and hadn’t done anything yet. I wanted to at least do a little research before we left.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s find a place where we can get out of the rain. We can get umbrellas at the convenience store if we need them.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ok.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mayuri-san, let’s head back to the station for now!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, it’s raining!”[%p]
The rain started to come down harder as we ran toward the station.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hyah! I’m soaked!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“We should’ve bought the umbrellas first, huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We need to take a shower or we’ll catch a cold!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I know! Kagari-san, want to come to Mayushii’s house? We can take a shower together!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“—Huh?”[%p]
Mayuri turned around and suddenly stopped.[%p]
I stopped, too.[%p]
I looked back and saw that Kagari wasn’t keeping up with us.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
She was standing some distance away, with a blank look on her face.[%p]
She was facing us, but seemed to be staring off into the distance.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san? What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...I can hear it.”[%p]
Her voice was flat and emotionless. It was like she was a different person than the one that had been there a moment before.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What can you hear?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...A voice.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I hear a voice.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari...san?”[%p]
Mayuri started to walk toward Kagari.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I—”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I have to go—”[%p]
And suddenly—[%p]
Kagari ran through the puddles of water and out into the street.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san!”[%p]
A truck was coming.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san! Run!”[%p]
Mayuri screamed—[%p]
And my body moved on its own.[%p]
I yanked Mayuri’s shoulder down and knocked her to the ground so that she couldn’t run out on her own.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kyah!”[%p]
And then I used that momentum to run out into the street myself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
