December, 2011.[%p]
Akihabara.[%p]
A year after all the chaos, Maho visited the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici for the first time in a long while.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh? She’s here!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s been a long time, everyone.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, it’s Maho-san! I’ve missed you! Tutturu♪!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s good to see you again, Maho-san.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m glad to see you’re doing well, nya.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Heh. It’s good to see nothing’s changed here.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah. Looks like not much has changed with you, either.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I know I’m still short. You don’t have to tell me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Non era quello che intendevo.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I know. It was a joke.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uhoohh...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“W-What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’ve been so lonely without you for the past year, Maho-san!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“W-Wait! You don’t need to grab me like that...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“B-But... but...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m sorry. I wanted to come back during the summer, but a lot happened at the university...”[%p]
The events of last January had left deep scars on Maho’s lab.[%p]
Of course they had.[%p]
Not only was Amadeus involved, but many people in the college, including Dr. Reyes, had been involved as well.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks for coming all this way, Maho.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Of course. I was a part of this, too. I’ve got a responsibility to see it to the end.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But are you sure? All the cleanup work you did over the last year will go to waste.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It won’t go to waste. You’re the one who said this world’s future would connect to the past.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So I’ve done what I can in this world.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah, you’re right.”[%p]
I was supposed to die in 2025. But I was alive.[%p]
Everyone had been fooled.[%p]
The past me.[%p]
Everyone in the future.[%p]
The world... had been deceived.[%p]
I’d thought the future was certain.[%p]
But instead I found a future I didn’t expect.[%p]
So... wouldn’t I be able to deceive the world, too?[%p]
And by doing so, avoid the future that awaited us?[%p]
And if I could deceive the world, maybe I could find Steins Gate.[%p]
But how to do so, unfortunately, was beyond me right now.[%p]
But the future me had said...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Il cammino verso Steins Gate è difficile. Riprovare una o due volte probabilmente non ti porterà lì.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ma io credo che partire da lì sia il modo migliore per arrivarci.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Penso che molti futuri siano collegati al passato.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Quindi questo mondo in cui ci troviamo non è sprecato. È un mondo di cui abbiamo bisogno. O almeno, questo è quello che penso io.”[%p]
Many futures, all connected to the past—[%p]
That meant there was only one thing for me to do.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hashida-san, did you finish it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course. It’s ready to go.”[%p]
An old microwave, sitting in the back of the area di sviluppo.[%p]
It was the Macchina per il Salto Temporale that Maho had helped finish.[%p]
Daru had added a new function to it.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Still, it’s hard to believe that this thing controls the fate of the world.”[%p]
That’s right. Everything began here.[%p]
Our fate, and Kurisu’s, had all been ruined by this device.[%p]
The one difference between this and the old Microonde Telefonico was that this was connected to a smartphone, not an old feature phone.[%p]
Text messages to the past would be detected by SERN, no matter what I did.[%p]
Which meant we’d become a target.[%p]
That would mean taking this world, that I’d gained only at the cost of sacrificing Kurisu, right back to where we started.[%p]
There would be no point in that.[%p]
But there were other ways to communicate now, beyond simple le email.[%p]
There were other ways to send messages.[%p]
The software we used now, RINE, was one of them.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I call it the D-RINE.”[%p]
Of course, the idea of using the electrons of the CRT television in the Braun Tube Workshop to control gravity and create a [color index="280AA02D1400"]singolarità[color index="800000"] to send the message back in time was the same.[%p]
And the amount we could send was still 18 characters, same as the D-Mail.[%p]
But we didn’t have to worry about SERN finding it.[%p]
We didn’t have to worry about Mayuri being killed.[%p]
The only problem was that we couldn’t send messages back before we started using RINE, but there was nothing I could do about that.[%p]
The most important thing to do right now was make it possible.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sheesh... It was pretty hard to find a way to make sure no one would detect it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It took forever to find a place they weren’t watching.”[%p]
He’d complained, but he’d pulled it off anyway.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s my favorite right arm!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, haven’t heard that in a while.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But are you sure about this, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That’s right. This may only bring mew more pain, Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe you’re right.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I have to do it anyway.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
The Third World War was going to happen unless I could stop it.[%p]
Kagari and Suzuha’s presence made that obvious.[%p]
There was only one future that lay before us.[%p]
But it was another piece of the path that would lead us to Steins Gate.[%p]
To get there, I would have to go into the past and start over.[%p]
It would be fine.[%p]
I was capable of starting over as many times as I needed to now.[%p]
I could overcome anything.[%p]
Until I reached the promised door.[%p]
I already had the message I was going to send.[%p]
Sending that message must have been why I’d come to this linea di universo in the first place.[%p]
Of course, I didn’t know what I’d think, or what I’d do, when I received it.[%p]
But I knew I would be successful.[%p]
I would lead us[%p]
to another future.[%p]
And to another past.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kagari-san, are you nervous?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“If... If the past changes and the world’s at peace, maybe I’ll never see Mamma...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“La teoria dei campi attrattori says that what’s supposed to happen will happen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if the linea di universo changes, you’ll see Mayuri again.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Davvero?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. I guarantee it.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Isn’t that nice, Kagari-chan? Okarin guarantees it, so I’m sure it’s true. I’ll see you in the future, ok?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thanks, Uncle.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no need to thank me. I sowed the seeds of all this, anyway.”[%p]
And this was where things got really hard.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No... Let me say it anyway. Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Say that to Daddy, too! Please say it to your daddy!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thanks, Dad.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“More! Look up at me with dewy eyes and say it again, my daughter!”[%p]
When the past changed, everything I’d done in the past year would be undone.[%p]
All the futures I’d experienced and all the time it took me to come back would go away, too.[%p]
But they wouldn’t go to waste.[%p]
I was here now, and in the past, I was just about to begin my work.[%p]
And then the future lay beyond—[%p]
When all those lives came together, the door to the future would be waiting.[%p]
Steins Gate would be waiting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It is time! In the name of Hououin Kyouma, I now initiate Operation Helheim! Lab mems, are you ready?”[%p]
To find the way there, I would change the past again.[%p]
[name]Lab mems[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
Kurisu—so that someday we can be together once more.[%p]
