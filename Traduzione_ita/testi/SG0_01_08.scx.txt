[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I walked onto the grounds of Tempio Yanabayashi and quietly took a look around.[%p]
Several cats were sunbathing beneath the cold winter sky, but there was no sign of anyone else.[%p]
Lukako wasn’t back from school yet.[%p]
Ok. I could talk to [Kurisu] without anyone staring at me here.[%p]
I was supposed to meet with Dr. Leskinen and Maho after this.[%p]
Before that happened, I wanted to confirm something with [Kurisu].[%p]
I decided to start the app.[%p]
Whenever I talked to [Kurisu], I needed to pay attention to where I was.[%p]
People would stare if I did it in a crowded place.[%p]
And I couldn’t do it around my family, or anyone I knew.[%p]
In that sense, with the exception of the fact that Lukako and Mayuri might show up, Tempio Yanabayashi wasn’t a bad spot.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Ciao.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We need to talk.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You’re meeting with the professor and Senpai after this, right? Is that what this is about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Is there any reason to be nervous? Basically, you’re turning over the logs and then they’ll ask you some quick questions about your impression of me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s it. The logs. That’s what I wanted to talk about. Have all of our conversations been recorded?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I told you that when we started, right? I keep logs in a place where nobody but me can access them. Were you not listening?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you’re going to submit them to the professor and Hiyajo-san?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Probably.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which means if I say anything personal to you, Dr. Leskinen and Hiyajo-san will hear it?!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You... You’re just realizing this now?”[%p]
Yeah, it was a little late. [Kurisu] and I had been talking for two weeks.[%p]
I should have asked about this when I got the access key for Amadeus.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I just realized today.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, have I told you anything I shouldn’t have so far?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Like the fact that you were barely able to talk to any girls at the matchmaking party?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Or the fact that your family sells vegetables, but you hate eggplants?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t hate eggplants. I’m just not very good at eating them.”[%p]
If that was all, I didn’t really care...[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Or the fact that the first time we talked, you called me ‘Christina’?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please forget about that.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Human memories are ambiguous, and as time passes they become more subjective and tend to be compressed into a single narrative.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Regardless of whether the memory is a good or a bad one, it’s common to only be able to remember words that left an impression. And that impression will often alter your memories of the surrounding conversation.”[%p]
Huh...?[%p]
What was she talking about?[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. That’s just how human memories work.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“But Amadeus isn’t a human. It’s an incomplete AI, still in the research stage.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“This is a big problem for Maho and the professor... But actually, Amadeus still can’t perfectly replicate the ambiguity of human memories.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“In other words, it can’t completely replicate the high-level brain function that is ‘forgetting.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh? But at the ATF seminar, Dr. Leskinen said that Amadeus would forget unneeded information...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Yes, I do forget things. But remember what I said? I record things in a log, like it’s my ‘secret diary.’”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“So in the end, all the information is still kept there. And if I load that, all the data I should have forgotten will come flooding back to me. Ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
In other words, asking her to forget was a waste of time?[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Another plan would be to delete my logs... but those are my backups, so that’s not happening.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Even if I could delete one area, the result would be the same. I would analyze the surrounding conversation and automatically reconstruct the missing portion.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“If you want to alter my memories... you’d have to mess with the primary program.”[%p]
I didn’t have that level of access, and I didn’t understand how the program worked at all.[%p]
So basically, until I told [Kurisu] why I called her Christina, she was going to keep asking.[%p]
What a pain.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“So? Why Christina?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You really don’t give up, do you? I’ll hang up right now if I have to.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Even if you run, as I’ve just explained, I won’t forget.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“The more you try to change the subject, the more interested I get, you know?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Or is this a ploy to get me to pay attention to you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one who wants attention. You call me in the middle of my university lectures.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And not only that, you message me all the time on [color index="280AA02D1400"]RINE[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve got too much curiosity. If you keep poking your head into things, one of these days you’re going to regret it.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“A-A scientist can’t function if they’re not curious!”[%p]
She got mad at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you’re that interested in why I call you Christina, why not come up with a theory yourself?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I have a few, actually. Listen to these.”[%p]
She’s really into this.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Theory 1: You’ve got a crush on a Hollywood actress named Christina.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You think you’ve got the looks of a Hollywood actress?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Looks don’t matter. It’s like how you feel a closeness to someone with the same name.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So this is what you’re saying, in other words.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Okabe Rintaro feels close to me.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I-It’s just an example. Don’t try to read too deep into it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a joke.”[%p]
Whenever I talked to [Kurisu], I always wanted to tease her. I needed to watch out.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Theory 2: You once dated a foreign girl named Christina.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Given your terrible English ability, this one is out of the question, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s possible that I dated a blonde babe who also spoke fluent Japanese, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Did you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Silence is an admission of defeat.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Scusa.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Theory 3: You knew the original me, and called her that either directly or indirectly.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“This is also unlikely. If you called me that, I know what I’d say.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Stop adding -tina.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Yeah. That was exactly right.[%p]
That’s exactly what Kurisu said.[%p]
But I didn’t stop. Because...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was embarrassed.”[%p]
The genius named Makise Kurisu was the person I always wanted to be.[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I couldn’t bring myself to say her name, so I came up with a nickname to hide my embarrassment.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Embarrassment?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... Not just with the original, either. It happens when I’m talking to you, too.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I mean, I’ve never talked to a girl inside a monitor before.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“W-What?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Well... thank you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you blushing?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I-I am not.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I just didn’t expect that you’d treat me like a girl. It surprised me a little...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Even that reaction was just like Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That part of you, I really l—”[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Ho avuto un brivido.[%p]
What was I about to say?[%p]
This was a 3D model on a screen, a tiny collection of 0s and 1s in the shape of a human. What was I about to say to her?[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hey, can I ask you something?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“We knew each other, didn’t we?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“I mean... you and the original me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“If you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine, but what was our relationship? I’m kind of curious.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Did I not get mad when you called me Christina? Or did I get mad, but then laugh and forgive you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uh...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Non voglio morire...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
I was hit with a violent urge to throw up.[%p]
I could see Kurisu in front of me, covered in blood.[%p]
She was looking at me, her eyes cold.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You killed me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Hey, you’ve gone pale...”[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
I touched the smartphone and ended the call.[%p]
Then I became too dizzy to stand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...oh...”[%p]
I tried to throw up, but nothing came out.[%p]
My hands were shaking.[%p]
That’s right. I can’t change reality.[%p]
But there I was, trying to talk to [Kurisu] like nothing had happened.[%p]
I was treating her like the real Kurisu, and trying to avert my eyes from what I’d done.[%p]
I was just clinging to [Kurisu].[%p]
This was wrong.[%p]
Non dovrei più parlare con [Kurisu].[%p]
The call was from [Kurisu].[%p]
I hung up in the middle of the conversation, so she was probably mad.[%p]
Mad?[%p]
She was just an AI.[%p]
[Kurisu]’s anger was just a program.[%p]
[Kurisu] wasn’t Kurisu.[%p]
Don’t treat them like they’re the same.[%p]
Non dovrei più parlare con [Kurisu].[%p]
Just the incoming call was almost enough to trigger a flashback.[%p]
In my mind, I could see an image of Kurisu’s bloody face.[%p]
I should turn off my phone.[%p]
This was getting bad.[%p]
I couldn’t even stand up.[%p]
It’d been half a year, and things were still like this.[%p]
Even I was surprised.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
I resisted the impulse to try to throw up again.[%p]
Just... turn off... the phone.[%p]
I wanted to get away from [Kurisu].[%p]
It wasn’t her fault.[%p]
It was mine.[%p]
I couldn’t become dependent on Amadeus.[%p]
This wasn’t right, and I needed to stop.[%p]
I was blaspheming Kurisu’s memory.[%p]
She had sacrificed herself to send me to the linea di universo Beta.[%p]
I needed to live up to her expectations.[%p]
I couldn’t waste time talking to [Kurisu].[%p]
I needed to accept the fact that I couldn’t save her, and move on.[%p]
Cut the power, and shut off this call.[%p]
At least, until you meet Dr. Leskinen after this...[%p]
Get Kurisu out of your mind.[%p]
Don’t panic.[%p]
Calmati.[%p]
Turn off... the phone...![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Che succede?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“You know exactly what it is. It’s rude to just hang u—”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Is something wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“But you look so pale.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s nothing, really. Leave me alone. It’d help a lot if you wouldn’t talk to me for a while...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Don’t push yourself too hard. Contact somebody you know, ok?”[%p]
[name]Amadeus Kurisu[line]“Bye.”[%p]
[Kurisu] gave up easier than I expected.[%p]
Maybe she realized that as an intelligenza artificiale, there was nothing she could do...[%p]
Realized?[%p]
I was making her sound like a real person.[%p]
And the second that thought crossed my mind, I almost saw an image of a bloody hand. I gritted my teeth and waited for it to pass.[%p]
I should really turn my smartphone off until I calmed down a little.[%p]
I was fine just a moment ago.[%p]
But now even hearing [Kurisu]’s voice was enough to send me into a panic.[%p]
I’d gone back to how I was half a year ago.[%p]
Back then, even hearing Kurisu’s name was enough to make me dizzy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I shouldn’t have messed with this...”[%p]
I shouldn’t have tried to chase Kurisu’s shadow.[%p]
For now, I should just turn off the smartphone.[%p]
But... in the end, I couldn’t make that decision.[%p]
The phone went silent.[%p]
I slowly stood up.[%p]
If Lukako saw me like this, he’d worry.[%p]
I should get out of here.[%p]
I was staggering a little, but I could walk.[%p]
I felt very thirsty.[%p]
I gulped down an entire bottle of mineral water and caught my breath.[%p]
There was still a little time before my meeting.[%p]
I wanted to get some air up here and recover a little.[%p]
I looked down over the scenery below the overpass.[%p]
The city was in the Christmas spirit. The atmosphere was charged with excitement.[%p]
It was the exact opposite of me.[%p]
I took more deep breaths.[%p]
I still felt like I wanted to throw up.[%p]
I was getting a headache, too.[%p]
If I went to Dr. Leskinen like this, I’m sure I’d worry him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
And then I realized that the two girls coming up the stairs were looking at me. I peered into the late-afternoon darkness to try and make out their faces.[%p]
One of them, the girl with the short haircut, waved.[%p]
[name]Ragazza con i capelli corti[line]“I knew it. It’s Okarin-san.”[%p]
[name]Ragazza con i capelli lunghi[line]“Hi there.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, you’re Mayuri’s friends.”[%p]
They were Mayuri’s friends and fellow cosplayers.[%p]
I think their cosplay names were... Kaede and Fubuki.[%p]
I didn’t know their real names.[%p]
Which was Kaede and which was Fubuki, again?[%p]
[name]Ragazza con i capelli lunghi[line]“Are you ok? You don’t look so good.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sto bene.”[%p]
If I made them worry here, and they talked to Mayuri, it would cause a big fuss. I didn’t want her to worry about me when she didn’t have to.[%p]
I shouldn’t have come back to Akihabara, anyway.[%p]
I’d run into people I knew just walking through town.[%p]
I should have gone toward Kanda when I left the shrine.[%p]
[name]Ragazza con i capelli corti[line]“You always look like you’re hurting somehow, Okarin-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do I?”[%p]
[name]Ragazza con i capelli corti[line]“You do.”[%p]
[name]Ragazza con i capelli lunghi[line]“Fubuki-chan...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“And when Mayushii looks at you, she looks like she’s in pain, too.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“And when I see her looking at you, I feel like I’m going to cry...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Wait, what am I saying?”[%p]
This Fubuki girl must really care about Mayuri.[%p]
I felt a little better after hearing that.[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Who’s the girl you like?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?!”[%p]
The girl... I like?[%p]
An image of Kurisu appeared in the corner of my eye again.[%p]
The feeling in my hands when I took her life came back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
No. Calmati.[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Okarin-san?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“I-I’m sorry. That was rude to ask!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Um, I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Okarin-san?”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Are you really ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-Yeah... I’m fine.”[%p]
Kaede and Fubuki were looking at me, worried.[%p]
I got away from them as fast as I could.[%p]
