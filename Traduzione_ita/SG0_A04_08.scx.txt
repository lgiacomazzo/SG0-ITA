[name]Fubuki[line]“Ok, Mayushii. We’ll be back.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok, bye!”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Luka-kun, let’s cosplay next time, ok?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“U-Um... I’ll think about it.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Okarin-san, everyone, thanks for having us over.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Come back any time.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-What is it?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Okarin-san, you’ve kind of changed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have I?”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“Yeah! You seem a lot easier to talk to now.”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“Come on, Fubuki-chan. It’s rude to say that to his face.”[%p]
[name]Fubuki[line]“What? You were saying it too a minute ago, Kaede-chan!”[%p]
[name]Kaede[line]“H-Hey!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sheesh...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Oh, then I guess I’ll be leaving too.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’ve got work again today?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Yup. I’ll call you when I’m off. Let’s make plans for this weekend.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Kk. I’ll be waiting for you!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What? What’s this? Daru-nyan and Yuki-nyan seem like they’re an item, nya!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“D-Do we? But my love for you will never change, Faris-tan!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, Dad! Not again!”[%p]
It had been several days since then.[%p]
All the chaos with Amadeus and Kurisu’s memories had calmed down, and normal life had resumed.[%p]
There had been no official announcements about what had happened in the basement of Tokyo Denki University.[%p]
The next day, the basement had been sealed off because of what was described as a lab accident.[%p]
The military, or maybe Stratfo, had covered it up.[%p]
And since then, we hadn’t seen anything strange going on around us.[%p]
There should have been no traces that we were ever there.[%p]
They probably weren’t going to come after us.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, what happened back there?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Back there?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When that woman tried to download Makise Kurisu’s memories into Kagari, it didn’t work, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Think it was just a system error?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Daru-nyan’s right. You probably shouldn’t overthink it, nya.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hmm... I don’t know. It’s been bothering me.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Come to think of it, when that happened...”[%p]
Kagari seemed to have been thinking of something. She opened her mouth to speak.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No, but...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, Kagari. Don’t stop your sentence halfway through. You’re just making me wonder more.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I thought I heard a voice back then.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“A voice?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah. There was someone in my head saying, ‘No!’”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t really remember all that happened, so maybe it was just a dream...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Amadeus...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Could it have been Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Maybe at the last second, she refused to allow her memories to overwrite Kagari-san’s?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not a very logical opinion to be coming from you, Maho.”[%p]
But Lukako and Mayuri stared at each other when they heard Maho’s words.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... the last time we activated Amadeus-san, the call cut off halfway through.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Your bot was talking, but she seemed like she was in a really big hurry and hung up.”[%p]
Could that have been when it happened...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But is that possible?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I don’t know. But Amadeus is just like a human. She has self-defense instincts.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So it’s possible that she realized her memories were going to be used for something wrong.”[%p]
In a different linea di universo, Kurisu’s memories had once existed inside Kagari.[%p]
Maybe Kurisu had saved Kagari from experiencing the same fate here.[%p]
There may have been another reason, but at least, that was what I wanted to think.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, Okarin. There’s something I don’t understand, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You were saying that Amadeus caused a lot of linea di universo changes before now, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But if we still remember what happened, that means the linea di universo didn’t change, right? Why is that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, that?”[%p]
I’d thought about that right after what had happened.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is just a guess, but I think that whenever I’d done something involving Amadeus, it had caused Kurisu’s memories to fall into someone’s hands.”[%p]
Whoever had gotten the memories had used them to rewrite the past.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But this time, we deleted Kurisu’s memories, so that means there’s no linea di universo change.”[%p]
The cause of the battle between Stratfo and DURPA was gone.[%p]
And we’d gotten rid of the data that Kurisu had left behind.[%p]
The future created by Kurisu’s memories was gone.[%p]
But Suzuha and Kagari were still here.[%p]
If they were still here, then the future hadn’t changed that much.[%p]
Of course, I knew that.[%p]
Unless I could reach Steins Gate, the linea di universo convergence wouldn’t change.[%p]
But that didn’t mean that this was for nothing.[%p]
There was that small flash of insight I’d felt in 2036.[%p]
This world was another step toward it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So what’s the plan now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm... There’s a lot to do, but first...”[%p]
I took something out of the pocket of my lab coat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have a present for everyone.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What’s this?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lab mem badges. It identifies every one of us as members of the lab.”[%p]
OSHMKUFAHSA.[%p]
The badge had everyone’s initials on it.[%p]
Of course, Kurisu and Moeka’s were there too.[%p]
I’d added in Hiyajo Maho, Shiina Kagari, and Amane Yuki too.[%p]
Accepting the past for what it was, and connecting it to the future...[%p]
That was my job right now.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“A lab mem...”[%p]
Kagari held the badge to her chest happily.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’ve got another treasure now.”[%p]
The path that lay before me might be even harder than the one I’d traveled so far.[%p]
But I knew the light was still there at the end of it.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I think I understand why Kurisu and Okarin-san became friends.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I finally realize why my dad and everyone else relied on him so much.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And I know why Mamma always loved him, too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“K-Kagari-chan! That’s not right! Mayushii is Okarin’s hostage... So it’s not like...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, what? How come Okarin gets all the chicks?! Explode all i normie!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’ve got Mom, Dad!”[%p]
Many different futures and many different pasts...[%p]
Where they all converge, I know I’ll find you.[%p]
So—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes, it’s me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? When am I coming to save you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t panic. Now is not the appointed hour.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... Who do you think I am? Listen! I am the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, and I never go back on my word!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So for now, wait.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I shall release you from the chains of time that bind you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes... I promise.”[%p]
Kurisu—until the day comes that we meet,[%p]
all I have, I give to you.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
