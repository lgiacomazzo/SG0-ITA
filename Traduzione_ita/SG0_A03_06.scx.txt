Kurisu’s memories were inside Kagari’s head.[%p]
Several days had passed since I’d begun to suspect my hypothesis was correct.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’m sorry, Okarin-san. I’ve caused a lot of trouble for you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s nothing, really. And I think Lukako and Mayuri are doing a lot more for you than me.”[%p]
In fact, Mayuri and Lukako were doing a very good job of taking care of her.[%p]
Mayuri may not have realized it, but Kagari looked up to her as a mother figure.[%p]
And after living under the same roof for so long, Lukako had come to care for her a lot.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s not true... All I’m doing is giving her someone to talk to.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s sorry that she can’t do more, you know?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No! That’s not true! Luka-kun’s being really nice, and just having Mamma around makes me happy.”[%p]
Mayuri fidgeted in embarrassment when she heard the word “Mamma.”[%p]
I could understand why.[%p]
It must feel strange to be called “Mamma” at her age, especially by someone who was older than she was.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hey, Mamma?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Can I give you a hug?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A hug?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Can I give you a hug like you always used to do for me when I was little?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fweeh? Wah, wah... I’m blushing!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I can’t?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No... Go ahead.”[%p]
Mayuri smiled and nodded, and Kagari gave her a big hug with a huge grin on her face.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan, you’re such a good girl.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ehehe!”[%p]
Mayuri never asked for details, but she seemed to sense what was happening to Kagari.[%p]
She probably understood that this was the best thing she could do right now.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma...”[%p]
It was strange.[%p]
Kagari was a lot older, but when they were like this they really did look like mother and child.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Thank you, Mamma.”[%p]
Kagari slowly moved away from Mayuri.[%p]
She looked a lot calmer than she had a moment ago.[%p]
It was probably ok to talk to her now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Allora, Kagari. Come va?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Come va? Hmm... penso di non saperlo?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Non lo sai?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sometimes I find myself remembering things, but I don’t know if they’re Kurisu-san’s memories or my own.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Complicated formulas, experiments... It’s like I don’t understand them, but I know them?”[%p]
Kagari’s only memories were of her time as a child and the time since Lukako’s father’s friend had found her.[%p]
Kurisu’s memories would appear sometimes and fill the gap in between.[%p]
I couldn’t even imagine how that must have felt.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um, just a while ago, I remembered Daddy. It was when Daddy told me I did good when I was little.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I remembered that, and it made me really happy...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But my parents died when I was a baby, and then Mamma Mayuri raised me. I don’t know who my dad is.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But even though it wasn’t my own experience, I really felt happy when he praised me.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And that just made my head feel all funny...”[%p]
Kagari grimaced and held her head in her hands.[%p]
The first time I’d met her, I’d been surprised by how much she looked like Kurisu.[%p]
But talking to her like this, I realized how different she was.[%p]
The way her expression was constantly changing, and the way she always slightly overreacted, was actually more like Mayuri.[%p]
Was that because they were mother and child?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So... Do Kurisu’s memories come out often?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah. A lot more than they used to, maybe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Capisco...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin. What’s going to happen to Kagari-chan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Normally, the best thing we could do is get her looked at by a team of specialists.”[%p]
But given her position, it wasn’t that easy.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t really want an exam. That was all I did when I was little.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yup. They said it was to treat my PTSD.”[%p]
So she didn’t seem eager to be looked at either, huh?[%p]
If more of Kurisu’s memories woke up, what would happen to her?[%p]
Would she be Shiina Kagari, with the memories of Makise Kurisu?[%p]
Or would she become Makise Kurisu?[%p]
A person’s personality was more than just the sum of their memories.[%p]
But memories were an important part of it.[%p]
Once she had Kurisu’s memories, what would happen to her?[%p]
At this point, no one knew.[%p]
It was quite possible that up until now, no one had ever shared a person’s memories before.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, Mayuri-chan. It’s time.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re right. Hey, Okarin. Can you take care of Kagari-chan?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We’ve got a meeting at school about our post-graduation plans. And we have to go.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Sorry...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t apologize. And don’t worry. I’ll take her home.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok, Kagari-chan. See you tomorrow.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Bye, Mamma. See you tomorrow.”[%p]
Once Mayuri and Lukako were gone, it was just me and Kagari in the room.[%p]
After the problems with Kagari’s memories started coming up, I’d been having her hold off on her job at the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
But I was still having her come here as much as possible during the day, in case something happened.[%p]
Suzuha and Tennouji were downstairs. That alone made me feel better.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
I suddenly felt Kagari looking at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“C’è qualche problema?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I just realized how strange it is to be talking with you like this, Okarin-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Strange? Why?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Because to me, you were always just this person I heard stories about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stories?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yup. Uncle Daru and Mamma would tell me about you.”[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
According to Suzuha, I was going to die in 2025.[%p]
Which meant that in Kagari’s time, I was no longer alive.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma talked about you all the time.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“‘Okarin saved your mamma. Okarin is Mamma’s Hikoboshi.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She still talks like that in the future?”[%p]
Now it was my turn to be embarrassed.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“So I always wondered who this Okarin-san person was that my mom cared about so much.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Who was this Okabe Rintaro that everyone talked about?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Maybe... I always admired you, a little?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop teasing me.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ahaha. You’re blushing, Okarin-san.”[%p]
Kagari clearly had the upper hand here.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, but that’s probably true of Makise Kurisu, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah, Mamma and Uncle Daru used to talk about Makise Kurisu all the time.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“She died so long ago... I wondered what kind of person could have that much influence on things.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What... What did Mayuri say about her?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“She said she was someone important to you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
—Someone important to me.[%p]
For me, that was an undeniable truth.[%p]
But that wasn’t true for the rest of the lab.[%p]
In this linea di universo, Mayuri had never met Kurisu. And I’d tried as much as possible to avoid bringing her up.[%p]
But thanks to me, even in the future, she’d still feel that way.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, I know. I’m going shopping. Want to come with me?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Shopping?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. You still don’t know this area well, do you?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Can I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course.”[%p]
After what happened in the last linea di universo, it was probably a good idea to keep her from going outside too much. But she probably needed a change of pace.[%p]
It was still afternoon. As long as we stuck to busy streets, we’d probably be fine.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yay! There’s actually a lot of things I’ve been wanting.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Things?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Just some basic necessities.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Isn’t Lukako getting you those things?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah, but he’s a boy, right? So I didn’t want to ask him for too much.”[%p]
True. Even if he was beautiful, Lukako was a guy.[%p]
There were some things he just wouldn’t understand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ok, let’s go.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Va bene.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow, this really is amazing.”[%p]
Kagari’s eyes were shining as she looked up and down the street.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“There are so many people, and so many stores. It’s hard to believe it’s the same Akihabara.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s Akihabara like in the future?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The best way to describe it is... hmm... a pile of rubble. Well, that goes for more than just Akihabara, though.”[%p]
Suzuha had said that the Third World War would start soon.[%p]
Which meant that a young Kagari would have only known the world after that horrible war.[%p]
Of course, that was all my fault—probably.[%p]
If I did what Suzuha wanted and went back to July 28th... Would the linea di universo change so that the Third World War never happened?[%p]
...Impossible. The le linee di universo were going to converge no matter what I did.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, Okarin-san. Are you telling yourself that it’s your fault?”[%p]
I gasped. She’d read my mind.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I guess so. But you can’t think that. Nope!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“As far as I know, nobody, not Mamma or Uncle Daru, blamed you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Because they all believed that you’d do it some day.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um... what was it? Steins Gate? They believed you’d lead us there.”[%p]
I knew Kagari was trying to make me feel better.[%p]
And that Mayuri and Daru would probably never blame me.[%p]
But those words just made it worse.[%p]
Because I’d given up on everything.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, I’m... sorry.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I didn’t mean to make you feel bad.”[%p]
I must have had a pretty dark look on my face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... I’m the one who should apologize. But I’m not...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Stop! Stop! We’re not here to talk about that today. I don’t get a chance to go outside often, so let’s talk about something more fun, ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
Kagari’s mind was probably filled with memories of a painful war.[%p]
If nothing else, those were her only memories as “Shiina Kagari.”[%p]
But she was still trying to make me feel better.[%p]
Even if they weren’t related by blood, she really was Mayuri’s daughter.[%p]
Still, it was hard to come up with something that was more fun to talk about...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, I know. I want to hear about what Mamma was like when she was young.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I mean, I know she’s still young right now.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But when she was younger... Like when she was a hostage?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri told you about that?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah. I love the look on her face when she talks about you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It’s like she’s softly opening the lid of a treasure chest, maybe?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Her face, her voice, just remembering it makes me feel warm.”[%p]
To Kagari, Mayuri must have felt like a star shining in a world of darkness and mud.[%p]
A star shining brighter than anything else in the night sky.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It was nothing, really.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Her grandmother died, and Mayuri really loved her. She looked so sad, like she was going to disappear any minute now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And then I said something really silly.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“‘You’re my hostage,’ right?”[%p]
Hearing it from another person made me so embarrassed that I wanted to go hide.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was young. The folly of youth, you know?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But those words saved Mamma, didn’t they?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I don’t know.”[%p]
If those words meant that I was holding her back... even all the way into the future...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, are you hungry? Let’s go get something to eat.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh? Oh, yeah...”[%p]
I started walking ahead in an effort to change the subject. Kagari seemed hesitant as she tried to keep up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is there anything you want to eat?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm... Anything’s fine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s always the answer that makes things the hardest, you know.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But everything in this era tastes so good. It’s amazing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did you eat in the future?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mostly yams and stuff.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But Mamma would flavor them differently every day.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri... cooked?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Già.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Was her cooking... well... good?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... see...”[%p]
The human animal was capable of growth, it seemed.[%p]
Well, Yuki had been teaching her a lot lately.[%p]
Maybe that had paid off.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“So anything’s fine, really.”[%p]
All right, then.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Welcome back, myaster!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh, Okarin! And Kagari-nyan, too!”[%p]
I’d chosen to stop by MayQueen+Nyan², and it was packed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s busy today.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyat’s right. We just started an anime tie-in campaign, nya.”[%p]
Come to think of it, there was a sign out front with some anime characters on it. I’d seen those characters all over town.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So the place is packed, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If you’re willing to wait 30 minutes, I can seat you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll take a rain check then, ok?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yeah. Let’s come back some day when it’s a little slower.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“My nyapologies, guys...”[%p]
We left MayQueen+Nyan² and walked around for a bit, but it was lunchtime and every place we saw was crowded.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow, there’s people everywhere.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right. They should all just eat at home instead of going outside.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ahaha! But that goes for us too, doesn’t it?”[%p]
Now then, what to do?[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Should we eat at the lab?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just so you know, I can’t cook.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Me neither!”[%p]
Then that was out of the question.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It doesn’t have to be anything complicated. I always wanted to try that one thing... You know, the noodles you put hot water on?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Instant noodles? You sure that’s what you want?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Um, in the future, a lot of factories go away, so it’s a lot harder to get.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uncle Daru was always talking about how he wanted some, so I wondered what they tasted like.”[%p]
If she was ok with that, so was I.[%p]
And I had just the thing.[%p]
We bought a lot of instant noodles at the local convenience store.[%p]
If there were any left, Daru would probably eat them.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wow, I didn’t know there were so many different types of instant noodles.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Unlike the future, there’s all kinds of different ones now. Convenience stores get new stuff almost every week.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You’re right. So I can pick any of these?”[%p]
Kagari looked inside the plastic bag I was holding.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course. Take your favorite.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“All right, which should I pick then? Hmm... hmm...”[%p]
She looked just like a child, the way she put her finger to her lips as her eyes shone.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’ll have this one! Salt flavor!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can take two or three if you want.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Really?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, but if I eat too many, I’ll get fat.”[%p]
She had so many different expressions that I never got tired of watching them.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hey, didn’t you also get something else while we were there?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yup. This.”[%p]
I took something plastic out of the bag.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Is this...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A fork. I thought it might be hard to eat with chopsticks.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can keep it and leave it in the lab.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Is that really ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s nothing special, really.”[%p]
Kurisu had always wanted her own fork.[%p]
I knew this didn’t make up for anything.[%p]
I just wanted to do it.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yay! Thank you! Honestly, I’m not very good with chopsticks. Mamma always lectured me about it.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, it’s got a bunny on the end. How cute!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ehehe!... My own fork. This means I own two things now.”[%p]
The other must have been the key chain that Mayuri gave her.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t know why, but... It feels like I’ve always wanted this.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Could this be one of Kurisu-san’s memories?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t really know.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hey, Okarin-san. You were in love with Kurisu-san, weren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha—Gah! Gack!”[%p]
I almost choked at the unexpected change in the direction of the conversation.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Are you ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-Where did that come from?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Because that’s what it means when someone is important to you, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“So, is it true? Did you love her?”[%p]
She seemed genuinely interested.[%p]
I guess she was the right age for that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, it’s true that meeting her changed my life.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You changed the subject! No fair!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But... I like the idea of someone being so important to you that they change your life.”[%p]
She’d changed everything, past and future.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“So, Okarin-san, what kind of person do you think she was?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you interested?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I want to know more about the person who owns these memories in my head.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You still have her memories even if I don’t tell you, right?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But I can’t force myself to remember them. Sometimes they just come out in fragments.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And it’s all really complicated stuff.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“So I want to know more about what kind of person she was, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Kagari had never actually met Kurisu, had she?[%p]
If she was sharing the memories of someone she’d never met, it would make sense if she wanted to know more about her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She... Makise Kurisu... was a very curious girl.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I see, I see.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And she was stubborn. If she thought she was right, she would never back down, no matter what.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I see.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She was arrogant and strong-willed, but also really lonely...”[%p]
The memories of all the conversations I had with Kurisu, and everything I’d gone through with her, came flooding back into my mind.[%p]
I’d talked to her here just like this once before, come to think of it.[%p]
Not in this linea di universo, though.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And she was scary when she got mad.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Scary? How?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’d say stuff like, ‘I’ll cut open your skull and jam an electrode into your hippocampus!’”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Fweeh...”[%p]
And then for some reason she ran a few steps forward and spun around.[%p]
E poi...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You keep talking like that, and I’ll cut open your skull and jam an electrode into your hippocampus!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Should I cut open your skull and jam an electrode into your hippocampus right now?”[%p]
Kurisu...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Was it like that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, no...”[%p]
The memories of Kurisu inside Kagari...[%p]
If they could be perfectly replicated inside Kagari’s head... would Shiina Kagari become Makise Kurisu?[%p]
It was a stupid idea.[%p]
Personality and memories were different things.[%p]
But even so... if...[%p]
If her memories turned into Kurisu’s completely...[%p]
If that happened...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin...san...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Kagari wandered back up to me and put her weight against me.[%p]
It was so sudden I caught my breath.[%p]
I could feel her warmth on my chest.[%p]
The feeling of her skin...[%p]
It reminded me of Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kuri...su...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
The sound of her pained moan brought me back to reality.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-What’s wrong, Kagari?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“My head... My head...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your head hurts?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uwah...aah...”[%p]
Kagari’s body twitched in my arms.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No... No... I don’t want to go back.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Save me... Someone... Someone get me out of here!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong, Kagari?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Save me, Mamma! Why won’t you save me? Mamma! Mamma!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down! Calm down, Kagari!”[%p]
I grabbed her hands to keep her from struggling any more.[%p]
The people on the street were staring at me, but I didn’t have time to think about it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s ok. It’s ok...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uwahh... hahh... ah... Okarin...san...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you walk? Let’s get back to the lab.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
She’d finally calmed down, but seemed to still be in pain. I let her lean on my shoulder as I took her back to the lab.[%p]
Once we got back, she went to sleep and didn’t wake up.[%p]
Her headache seemed to have calmed down, but sometimes she would still moan.[%p]
I’d contacted Mayuri and the others, and they were probably going to arrive soon, but...[%p]
The words she’d said before...[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Save me... Someone... Someone get me out of here!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Save me, Mamma! Why won’t you save me? Mamma! Mamma!”[%p]
What was that?[%p]
Were those fragments of her lost memories?[%p]
If that was the case, then she really was...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
Just as I went to look at the clock, the door opened and Mayuri and Lukako came running in.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Is Kagari-san ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. She’s sleeping now.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m so glad.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mm...”[%p]
She must’ve heard us talking, because Kagari’s eyes slowly opened.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kagari-san...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“H-Huh? Where am I?”[%p]
She looked around, afraid.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Calm down. You’re in the lab.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The lab...? Japan?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right. Akihabara, Japan.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Japan. I’m in Japan...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh, that’s right. That exchange program...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I need to get ready for the lecture, don’t I?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Exchange program?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“She’s acting strange.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehi, Okarin...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Exchange program—[%p]
Lecture—[%p]
Those were—Kurisu’s memories.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Huh? My paper! Where’s my paper?! I worked really hard on it so I could show it to Dad!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down, Kagari! Those aren’t your memories!”[%p]
Kagari looked up at me in a daze.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin...san...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right. Your name is Shiina Kagari. Not Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Kagari... My name is Kagari...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Uwah... Aah...!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“AAAAAAHHHHH!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, sorry. Can you handle this?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Sì.”[%p]
Kagari was confused for a while after that, but she gradually started to calm down again.[%p]
Once it seemed safe to do so, I’d taken her back to Tempio Yanabayashi.[%p]
But maybe we weren’t going to be able to look after Kagari ourselves, after all.[%p]
Maybe we should take her to a hospital?[%p]
Was it my ego that was stopping me from doing so?[%p]
I kept thinking about that as I walked along.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s gonna stay over tonight, ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-Yeah. That would be a big help.”[%p]
It would make Kagari feel a lot better.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Try to treat her like you normally would, as much as possible.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah. Ok...”[%p]
I told her to contact me right away if anything came up, then headed back to the lab.[%p]
