[name]Rintaro[line]“Now that the causal link has been established, allow me to explain the final stage of the plan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The purpose of this plan is to change divergence and reach the unknown linea di universo called ‘Steins Gate.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, I’m the one who named it ‘Steins Gate.’ You, of all people, know why I chose that name.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“‘It doesn’t really mean anything.’ Isn’t that right?”[%p]
—2025 A.D.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici, aka “The Lab.”[%p]
It was also the headquarters of the resistenza organization Valchirie.[%e]
Once located in a room in a multipurpose building in Akihabara, it had been moved to a new base after the Third World War.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The place was far too filthy to really be called a lab.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But it was, without doubt, the home of the best minds in the world as they searched for a way to reach Steins Gate.[%e]
In the center of the room—[%p]
[margin top="38"]Okabe Rintaro was delivering a monologue, posing like a stage actor as his white coat flapped.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We reached the moment that you’re in right now because we wanted to save Kurisu...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My preparations are complete. The rest is up to you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The final phase of [color index="280AA02D1400"]Operazione Skuld[color index="800000"] will now commence.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your mission: change the outcome without changing established events.”[%p]
“Kurisu,” aka Hiyajo Maho, was staring at him, annoyed, from a distance away.[%p]
[margin top="38"]“Kurisu” was Maho’s codename in Valchirie.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Sigh...”[%p]
Maho turned toward Hashida Itaru, who was sitting right next to her.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Hey, is that really the right way to go about this?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, probably.”[%p]
Itaru was grinning.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He was history’s greatest super hacker, and he loved Hououin Kyouma too much.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Isn’t Okabe Rintaro going to be embarrassed when he sees that with everyone else in 2010?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t worry. Back then, he was even more amazing.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, I see...”[%p]
Maho sighed and shook her head.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But even as she sighed, inside, she was so sad that she felt her heart was going to burst.[%e]
She probably wasn’t the only one feeling that way.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Itaru, Urushibara Luka, and even Akiha Rumiho (who was doing the filming) all seemed a little sad when they thought about what was to come.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Deceive yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Deceive the world.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That is the choice which will lead you to Steins Gate.”[%p]
And then Okabe walked toward the camera that Rumiho was holding.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He’d insisted on standing away from the camera with his back turned “to give it more atmosphere.” So why was he walking toward it now? Maho sighed again.[%e]
Okabe took the camera from Faris and brought the lens up to his face.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And then he said the final line.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I pray for your success, you insane mad scientist.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“El.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Psy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kongroo.”[%p]
And then he stopped the recording.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And the video message to the past was complete.[%e]
It had taken fifteen years to get to this point.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was such a long time,[%p]
and at the same time, it had felt so short.[%e]
[name]Faris[line]“Ok, that should do it, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right. Now we just send the D-Mail back into the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, don’t screw up the sender or the timing, ok?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Right! We’re sending that one to your phone in 2010!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“And Itaru-san’s video message goes to Suzuha-chan in 2011.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. You’ve got it.”[%p]
Okabe came over to Maho and the others, his white lab coat flapping as he walked.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Good work.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The way to Steins Gate is now open.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is all I can do. The rest is up to the me in 2010.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it? You look so glum.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s because... Everyone’s so worried.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Our first trial of the time machine is going to be a manned experiment.”[%p]
Maho looked up at the huge time machine—Unit Number “FG-C193”—behind them.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was almost the same shape as the C204 model that had appeared in Akihabara in 2010, but it was still a prototype with many unstable parts.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. I trust my talented right arms. It’ll be a success.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re going to die in 2025. In this linea di universo, that’s unavoidable.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“But that doesn’t mean I want you to see you commit suicide.”[%p]
They’d had this debate a thousand times before.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Maho herself had thought she’d come to terms with it, but at the last minute, she found herself bringing it up again.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right. Suzuha told me once that I was going to die in 2025.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She said I died saving Mayuri from a thug with a knife.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri’s not here right now, but the le linee di universo always converge.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was sure I was going to die in 2025. But—”[%p]
Okabe flipped his white lab coat up a little too dramatically and put his hand to his chest.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t necessarily have to die, do I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Vanishing from the year 2025 is the same as dying, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...What do you mean?”[%p]
This theory was new to Maho.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words, I don’t have to die to leave the year 2025.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can travel to another part of time and space in our first time machine!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s some serious positive thinking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But as a theory, it works, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The world can be deceived.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That message from another linea di universo gave me courage.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What I’m about to do is also a trial run for Operazione Skuld.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Yeah. You’re right.”[%p]
But to Maho and the others, it was all the same.[%p]
[margin top="38"]After 2025, Okabe Rintaro would be gone.[%p]
He would never come back.[%p]
[margin top="38"]He wasn’t saying it, but he knew it, too.[%e]
He stared at each of his friends for a moment in turn, as if to help him memorize their faces.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Most of the founding members of Valchirie, and the former members of the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici, were here to see him go.[%e]
Hashida Itaru.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Akiha Rumiho, aka Faris NyanNyan.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Urushibara Luka.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Hiyajo Maho.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And standing quietly in the back, Hashida Yuki.[%p]
A seven-year-old Hashida Suzuha was hiding behind her legs.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Everyone, thanks for coming this far for someone like me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But the battle against the laws of God continues.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The next fight is in 2036.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Until then, keep it up.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good luck, Valchirie.”[%p]
As she listened to Okabe’s final goodbye—[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho tried her best to stop herself from crying.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She couldn’t cry here.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She’d decided long ago that she’d keep hope in her heart as she watched him go.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right, time to go catch my escaped hostage.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Take care of Suzuha, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Leave it to me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“With the buco nero di Kerr tracer loaded onto this thing, I’m sure I’ll be just fine.”[%p]
That was a special device that only the C193 was equipped with.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was capable of tracing the space-time distortion continuity created by a buco nero di Kerr, anywhere from 70 million years in the past to the future.[%p]
[margin top="76"]You could call it a time machine tracker.[%e]
It had been specially designed to allow them to find another time machine.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Of course, they had only one reason for making it:[%e]
To find Shiina Mayuri and Amane Suzuha, who’d gone beyond the space-time horizon on Tanabata in 2011.[%p]
[margin top="38"]They’d guessed that when the battery on the C204 failed, it had lost the ability to properly time travel.[%e]
So after finding them with the C193, Okabe would give them a spare battery and send them back to this time. If possible, he’d go too.[%p]
[margin top="38"]If they could do that, this mission would be 100% complete.[%e]
But doing that with this prototype time machine would be extremely difficult.[%p]
Okabe had to have known that.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Perhaps he was thinking of sacrificing himself to send Mayuri and Suzuha back to this time.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All right, I’m off.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“See you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“W-Wait! Wait!”[%p]
The last member of the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici, Shiina Kagari, came running onto the floor.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Kagari! I wondered why you weren’t here. Where have you been?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hahh... hahh... hahh...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sorry. I went to get this.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san, take this. For good luck.”[%p]
Kagari handed him a faded green Upa key chain.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You sure? This is important to you, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yes. That’s why I’m giving it to you. Make sure you give it back. And bring Mamma back, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Got it. I’ll bring it back. I promise.”[%p]
Okabe took the key chain and gave everyone one final, firm handshake.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Finally, he came to Maho.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...Stay safe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You too, Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... Maho.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...Hey.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Do you think Steins Gate really exists?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Do you really think there’s a world between, where both Mayuri-san and Kurisu survive?”[%p]
It was the first time she’d asked that in 14 years, since the battle began on that year’s Tanabata.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It does. I know it.”[%p]
Okabe Rintaro,[%p]
Hououin Kyouma,[%p]
answered her with a smile.[%e]
But his smile seemed so sad[%p]
[margin top="38"]that Maho couldn’t help but cry.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t cry.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I-I’m not crying! Sob...”[%p]
Maho gave him a hug,[%p]
and swore to herself that she’d never forget his warmth and conviction.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“Goodbye...”[%p]
Okabe nodded a little.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok! Everyone, step back!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We will now begin the operation. And the name of this operation shall be—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Operation Altair!”[%p]
He shouted as if trying to raise his own spirits, not just everyone else’s. And then he entered the cockpit of the FG-C193 time machine.[%e]
Maho and the others quickly began the countdown sequence to start the time machine.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Since this was a trial run, too, they needed to record all the data they could get.[%e]
A low roar enveloped the whole machine.[%p]
The vibration and noise were so loud that the building shook a little.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But as far as Maho could tell, the data was normal.[%e]
The thick hatch of the time machine was slowly closing.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Then there was the sharp sound of it sealing tight, cutting Okabe off from the rest of them forever.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s... going to work, right?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Don’t worry. Kyouma will do just fine, nya.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s right. He’s the man who makes the impossible possible.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. That’s our Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Okarin-san...”[%p]
A rainbow-colored fog started to rise up around the machine.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The sound of the engine grew so loud that it threatened to blow out their eardrums, and no one could hear a thing.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
Itaru screamed, unable to hold back any longer.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“It doesn’t matter if you’re supposed to die! Come back here anyway!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Everyone will be waiting! I’ll be waiting, too! So make sure you come back!”[%p]
As they screamed, the machine started to fade away...[%e]
And then...[%e]
Just as he’d promised on that distant day,[%p]
he followed the two Orihimes.[%p]
[margin top="38"]With a blinding flash of light, the time machine took off from the year 2025, heading for a time far away—and disappeared.[%e]
