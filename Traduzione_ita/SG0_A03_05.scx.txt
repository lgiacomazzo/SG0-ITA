Hiyajo Maho stared at her computer monitor in a daze.[%p]
The rest of the world was still feeling the afterglow of New Year’s excitement.[%p]
The last time she’d come to Japan, it was still in the heat of summer.[%p]
She’d used her vacation days to come then.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Her coworker, Makise Kurisu, had suddenly died,[%p]
and she wanted to see the place where she was murdered herself.[%e]
Maho’s feelings for Makise Kurisu were complicated.[%p]
Until Kurisu had come to her lab, Maho had thought herself a genius.[%p]
She’d graduated high school after skipping grades, and joined a university lab while still in her teens.[%p]
It was understandable that she’d feel that way.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Everyone else said she was a genius, too.[%p]
But her pride was shattered into tiny little pieces by the arrival of Makise Kurisu.[%e]
Makise Kurisu was the real thing.[%p]
Maho didn’t even come close to her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She had realized that she could never be as smart as Kurisu.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And she realized that she didn’t want to be beaten by her anyway.[%e]
It would’ve been so much easier if she could’ve hated her.[%p]
It would’ve been so much easier to hate Kurisu.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But Makise Kurisu wouldn’t even allow her that much.[%p]
She was a dedicated scientist, and that dedication carried over to her treatment of Maho, too.[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Senpai, I think your research has the potential to change the world.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If there’s anything I can do to help, I will. Just say the word.”[%p]
Someday, she swore, she’d surpass her.[%p]
Someday, she swore, she’d make Kurisu say that she was the smarter one.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But now that would never happen.[%p]
Makise Kurisu went away on a trip and never came back.[%e]
Maho had been told that she’d been attacked by a robber and killed.[%p]
But it didn’t seem real.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It felt like she’d come back to the lab any day now, and start arguing with the professors with that same self-satisfied smirk on her face.[%p]
Until then, Maho would work on the Amadeus project, so that when Kurisu came back, she would be amazed.[%e]
Amadeus...[%p]
An intelligenza artificiale that could be loaded with an individual’s memories.[%p]
[margin top="38"]It was possible to digitize memories by analyzing the nerve signals relating to the memories stored in the lobo temporale.[%p]
It had been Kurisu, of course, who’d proved it.[%p]
And then Maho and her team had turned that proof into usable technology.[%e]
By the time Kurisu got back, she would have it all ready for the next level.[%p]
She’d show it to Kurisu and astonish her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But even that hope didn’t last long.[%p]
She was suddenly told that the project was canceled.[%e]
Of course, she couldn’t accept it.[%p]
But no matter what she said, no matter how many times she argued with the professor, she couldn’t get the cancellation overturned.[%p]
Amadeus went to sleep at the bottom of the lab’s server...[%p]
Along with Makise Kurisu’s digitized memories.[%e]
—Makise Kurisu’s memories.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Now they were in the head of another girl.[%p]
[margin top="38"]How had that happened?[%p]
There was only one possibility, if it was possible at all.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Just like Okabe Rintaro had said—[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Oh?”[%p]
The door opened, and a large man she knew very well came inside.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Maho, what’s wrong? I thought you were still on your New Year’s holiday?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What about you, Professor? What are you doing here on your day off?”[%p]
Maho’s mentor, Dr. Leskinen, was here in Japan for a month-long conference on intelligenza artificiale.[%p]
Maho had come with him as his assistant.[%p]
But the conference didn’t take place every day. So they spent the time between sessions at the Japanese office, making presentation materials and exchanging le email.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“In my case, I don’t have much to do on my days off. It’s no fun sitting in the hotel, so I may as well come here and work.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Then I guess I’m the same.”[%p]
For a researcher, doing research was a hobby.[%p]
If nothing else, all the scientists Maho knew were like that.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Of course, she’d come here today because she’d assumed Dr. Leskinen would feel that way.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“You have a lot of things to do, don’t you? Dating, for instance...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Professor, if you keep that up, I’m going to sue you for sexual harassment.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Oh, anything but that.”[%p]
Dr. Leskinen slumped his shoulders in the unique way that Caucasians always overreacted.[%p]
He seemed intent on bringing Maho and Okabe together.[%p]
She and Okabe were both friends of Kurisu’s, and so they talked a lot, but there was nothing more to it than that.[%p]
At least, that’s what she thought. Probably.[%e]
[name]Maho[line]“All right. In lieu of an apology, can I ask you something?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Anything, if it will keep me out of court.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“All right... What’s going on with Amadeus right now?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“You should know the answer to that. Right now there’s no plans to continue the project.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I know that. What I’m asking is, what happened to the Amadeus data?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“It’s saved on the lab server, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Nobody else accessed it or took it out?”[%p]
Leskinen’s eyes narrowed, and he slowly shook his head.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Maho, I don’t know where you got that idea, but...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Amadeus access is limited to only a few people, and as far as I know, no one else has touched it.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“If nothing else, I haven’t received any reports about it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Then the same goes for my and Kurisu’s memory data?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Of course.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Then... is it possible there’s some other AI project going on that I don’t know about?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Of course not. You’re the most important member of our research team.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“We’ve lost Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“And it was a big loss, but I think you’re the only one who can take her place.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“So there’s no way I’d start a new project without you knowing, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...I see.”[%p]
The compliment felt like a bit too much for her to take at face value.[%p]
There were a lot of scientists who were always looking to get a leg up on the competition.[%p]
If someone else got the glory first, everything you worked on until that point would be useless.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Even in the same team, there were only a few people you could really trust.[%p]
But to Maho, Dr. Leskinen was one of those people.[%e]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Will that do for an answer?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yes...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Then may I ask you something? Where did this come from, all of a sudden?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Beh...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Are you worried that someone might have access to your secrets?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, something like that.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Then you don’t need to worry. Amadeus was developed so as not to share any secrets the original wouldn’t want shared.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“The same goes for the saved data.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Even if someone did steal it, the parts the original person wants to keep secret the most are kept within a black box.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“They can’t be accessed via Amadeus or from the memory data itself.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“If those secrets get out, it’s because a living human wanted them to.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A living human...”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“That’s right. The original person themselves, in other words.”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Well? Feel better?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, I guess so...”[%p]
It wasn’t that she didn’t trust Dr. Leskinen.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But she couldn’t relax until she’d seen for herself that no one had taken the data.[%p]
Maho only thought it was possible to believe something after you’d seen it yourself.[%p]
That’s how she thought a scientist should be.[%e]
But right now, she didn’t have the access rights to do so.[%p]
So in the end, she was stuck with her doubts.[%p]
She knew this was going to happen, but she couldn’t stop herself from asking anyway.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Oh? I didn’t expect to see you two here.”[%p]
Dr. Reyes walked through the door just as she finished her conversation with the professor.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“Christ. Don’t you two know it’s a holiday?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What about you, Dr. Reyes?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I’ve got nothing to do in my hotel.”[%p]
Maho exchanged a glance with Dr. Leskinen, then shrugged.[%p]
That’s just how scientists were.[%e]
[name]Reyes[line]“What? What? What’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Leskinen[line]“Hahaha...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Heh... It’s nothing.”[%p]
She and Dr. Leskinen laughed at Reyes’s confusion.[%p]
But the doubts in her mind lingered.[%e]
