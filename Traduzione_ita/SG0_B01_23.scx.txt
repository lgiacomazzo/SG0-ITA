[name]Rintaro[line]“Ha... ha... ha...”[%p]
I stuck my hand against the wall of the Braun Tube Workshop to catch my breath.[%p]
There was no sign of Mayuri.[%p]
I’d gone to MayQueen+Nyan², and to any shop I could imagine her visiting, and had no luck.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe-san!”[%p]
Maho came back. She was out of breath, too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you find her?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“No. I looked around and I can’t find her anywhere.”[%p]
The panic was threatening to make me lose control.[%p]
Where did you go, Mayuri...?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! Did you find her?”[%p]
I’d asked Daru to stay behind and call all of her friends and people she knew.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, the thing is...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The phone’s not picking up.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I called Mayuri a bunch of times, too, but it looks like her phone has been turned—”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s not it. It’s not just Mayu-shi, I can’t get a hold of anyone.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Actually, my phone’s had zero bars this whole time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
I took out my own phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Mine’s not getting service, either.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Me neither.”[%p]
The lab had never suffered from bad signal before.[%p]
We went up to the roof, and even tried holding our phones up to the sky, but—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The result was the same.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t work on the roof, either.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t get any signal, even outside.”[%p]
Daru looked for news on the internet.[%p]
Thankfully, the internet connection was still active.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, there’s breaking news!”[%p]
There was an article on the top page of Taboo! talking about a large-scale cell phone service outage.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, what is this?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“All cell towers in Akihabara, for all carriers, have stopped working?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“All carriers? Is that possible?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
It didn’t seem possible to me. Not under normal circumstances, anyway.[%p]
The events of a year ago—in the linea di universo Alfa—flashed through my mind.[%p]
That night, when Mayuri was mercilessly killed and all the safety I’d ever believed in was stripped away... That night, when all the pain began, started with a bomb threat at Akihabara Station that had shut down the train system.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Someone did this deliberately?”[%p]
—Something terrible was about to engulf Akihabara. That was the feeling I had.[%p]
I tried my best to fight off the flashback.[%p]
Now wasn’t a time to be scared.[%p]
I needed to find Mayuri.[%p]
I couldn’t leave her alone out there.[%p]
I gritted my teeth to fight off all the trauma I was carrying, and raised my head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, the internet’s still working, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, yeah. I’m talking to Luka-shi and Amane-shi on RINE right now.”[%p]
Okay. Then they should be willing to help look for Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to go look around again—”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hold it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There’s another thing that’s bothering me.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I went to @channel to look for information on the outage, and somebody’s cracked the Occult board—”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And the one doing the [color index="280AA02D1400"]cracking[color index="800000"] is, well, look.”[%p]
Daru brought up the @channel page on his screen for me to see.[%p]
I wondered why it could possibly matter, but decided to take a look anyway—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-What?”[%p]
“Salieri’s Neighbor”?![%p]
That was the nickname I’d used to make contact with “KuriGohan and Kamehameha!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What’s going on?”[%p]
I decided to leave the explanation for later, and clicked on the thread.[%p]
It was all comments by a single person.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“KuriGohan and Kamehameha...”[%p]
The first comment had gone up an hour ago.[%p]
After that it was just an endless string of meaningless numbers and letters.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What’s this supposed to mean?”[%p]
Maho was looking at the screen from the side and evidently sensed that something was amiss from the text.[%p]
I answered her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Amadeus.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the Amadeus [Kurisu].”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Something happened to [Kurisu]...”[%p]
This was some kind of message.[%p]
She was trying to contact me with it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The secret to controlling time...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Isn’t that the time machine?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...! Information about the time machine leaked to someone?!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, how does Amadeus know about the time machine? Did you tell her, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Did I?[%p]
I didn’t think I’d told her when I was a tester, but...[%p]
There was no time to think about that now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san, can you access Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s against the rules, but I guess now’s not a time to worry about that, is it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hashida-san, can I use your computer?”[%p]
Maho took Daru’s seat and used his PC to access the Istituto di Neuroscienze’s computers.[%p]
She put in her ID, “Salieri,” and her password.[%p]
She pushed the enter key, but Amadeus didn’t appear.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...This isn’t what usually happens. What’s going on?”[%p]
Confused, she typed a series of commands into the PC with a speed that rivaled Daru’s.[%p]
But no matter what she did, the Amadeus program didn’t appear on her screen.[%p]
When she’d finished accessing every server at the institute, she stared at the computer and bit her lip.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What’s going on here? This is just impossible...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened?!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...It’s gone.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Amadeus’s program and all the memory data... are gone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Just like the message from “KuriGohan and Kamehameha” said.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, hack it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not just the Istituto di Neuroscienze. Force open every bit of data Viktor Chondria has. Everything from servers to individual PCs.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san, help him. Please.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...R-Right...”[%p]
But the answer was the same.[%p]
Not only the Amadeus [Kurisu], but the [Maho] as well, were nowhere to be found on the Viktor Chondria servers.[%p]
There was no trace of them.[%p]
Their very existence had been erased.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Did they move them somewhere else?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s impossible. The only person with that level of administrator privilege for the Amadeus system is Dr. Leskinen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Dr. Leskinen...”[%p]
My mind flashed back to the message from KuriGohan and Kamehameha.[%p]
Who was the “Our father, in heaven,” whom [Kurisu] had spoken of?[%p]
If Amadeus considered anyone a father, it would be—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No way... Did Dr. Leskinen do it?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Don’t make assumptions like that.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s a lot more likely that his ID and password got cracked!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is there any way to get a hold of Dr. Leskinen?”[%p]
The phones weren’t working.[%p]
And there was no way to tell when he’d see an email or if he’d respond.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...”[%p]
Maho was thinking hard, but it didn’t seem like she was having any luck.[%p]
We were getting nowhere.[%p]
I was concerned about Mayuri, but I couldn’t ignore the danger that was right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For now, I’ll go to Radi-Kan. If [Kurisu]’s warning is right, that’s what they’ll be after.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll go, too—”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You and Hiyajo-san stay here and gather information! Mayuri might come back!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But if something happens, run!”[%p]
I gave my orders and ran out of the lab toward Radi-Kan.[%p]
