The dizziness stopped.[%p]
The room was pitch black.[%p]
There was no one there but me.[%p]
Even Suzuha, who should’ve been living here, was gone.[%p]
Daru, Mayuri, Faris, Luka...[%p]
And Kagari, too.[%p]
Everyone was gone.[%p]
I was so tired and sleepy.[%p]
I clutched my smartphone and laid down on the sofa.[%p]
I closed my eyes, too tired to think.[%p]
[name]???[line]“...Rin. Okarin!”[%p]
[name]???[line]“Wake up! It’s lunchtime!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
Someone was shaking me softly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! You’re sleeping too much!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san will be here soon!”[%p]
Kagari...?![%p]
The second I heard her name, my mind snapped back into alertness.[%p]
I forced myself to sit up.[%p]
I was sitting on the sofa in the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Outside the window, it was bright.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, you’re finally up.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪, Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-Sì...”[%p]
Mayuri nodded, satisfied, and left my side.[%p]
I took a look around the room.[%p]
The table was covered in notebooks and textbooks that seemed to belong to Mayuri. She was probably doing her homework.[%p]
I could see Daru’s huge back hunched over the PC.[%p]
The monitor was displaying a cute anime character.[%p]
He seemed to be playing another eroge.[%p]
From the look of things, the only people in the lab were him, me, and Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The time on my phone said it was just before noon...[%p]
Which meant I’d been asleep for more than 10 hours.[%p]
Oh no. I must have passed out before I checked to see if the linea di universo had changed.[%p]
I listened for a moment, and I could hear the usual bustling of Akihabara outside.[%p]
There was no sign of Stratfo.[%p]
That alone made me feel relieved.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? You looked like you were having a bad dream. Is everything ok?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-Sì...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Want some barley tea? You shouldn’t have Dr P right after you get up, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... Tea’s fine.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok. Got it.”[%p]
Mayuri went to the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, there aren’t any clean cups. Just give me a second, I’ll wash one.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine... No hurry.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, Mayu-shi! Mayu-shi! I’d like some tea, too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
This all felt like an old memory.[%p]
It seemed like ages ago when I’d last had a normal conversation like this.[%p]
But this was no time to be sentimental.[%p]
While Mayuri was washing the cup, I needed to get things straight in my head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...There was a linea di universo change, right?”[%p]
...In the end, I’d hesitated at the last second.[%p]
If Kagari... Or perhaps Kurisu... hadn’t stopped me...[%p]
maybe the linea di universo wouldn’t have changed, and Stratfo would’ve caught us.[%p]
But change it did.[%p]
I could still feel the lingering sensations from my Reading Steiner, so I was sure of it.[%p]
From the look of things, Mayuri and Daru were the same as ever, and the immediate danger was gone.[%p]
The reason for the change was probably the deletion of Kurisu’s memories from within Kagari.[%p]
Those memories must have included something that dealt with the time machine.[%p]
Which meant that their existence was important enough to control whether or not the linea di universo changed.[%p]
And I’d deleted them—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it could be the opposite, too.”[%p]
Maybe even if Maho’s program hadn’t worked right, and the memory rewrite failed, the linea di universo would’ve changed anyway?[%p]
Unlike last summer, it wasn’t clear what was making the linea di universo change now.[%p]
The first thing I needed to do was see if Kagari’s memories had been successfully rewritten.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Here you go!”[%p]
At the same time as I decided on my plan, Mayuri brought me a cup on a tray.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ll get some barley tea now, ok?”[%p]
She put the tray on the table and headed for the fridge.[%p]
I looked and saw that there were four cups on the tray.[%p]
...Four?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, why are there four cups?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Because Kagari-san’s going to want some, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
That’s right, Kagari...![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari’s coming?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She just sent me a message on RINE. She’ll be here soon.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“C-Capisco...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s she coming over for?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You called her. You sent everybody a message on RINE yesterday and said we all needed to meet here at noon.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s our third meeting to try and come up with a way to get her memories back.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s you, me, and Kagari-tan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Not that we’ve had any luck so far, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... called her...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wants to help, too, but I’ve got work today.”[%p]
I could hear Mayuri apologizing from the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I hope she gets her memories back soon.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It must be sad not to remember anything except the recent past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
She didn’t remember anything except the recent past...?![%p]
What was going on? Kagari should have still had her memories from when she was a kid.[%p]
Maybe trying to rewrite her memories had actually deleted them?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok, Okarin. Here you go!”[%p]
Mayuri handed me a cup filled with barley tea.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, thanks.”[%p]
I took the cup, trying my best to hide my internal shock.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ll leave yours here, Daru-kun.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I gulped down the tea, stood up from the sofa, and went over to Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm? What’s up?”[%p]
I lowered my voice so that Mayuri couldn’t hear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did the memory rewrite for Kagari succeed?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Or did it fail?”[%p]
Daru looked at me for a moment, confused.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
That wasn’t the answer I expected.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um... I’m asking if we succeeded in deleting Kurisu’s memories from Kagari’s brain.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What movie is that? It sounds scary.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Are you finally back to the old you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cos—!”[%p]
I froze for a moment.[%p]
Daru didn’t look like he was lying. He had no reason to lie, anyway.[%p]
Did that mean that in this linea di universo, Kurisu’s memories had never been implanted in Kagari?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“C-Come with me!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? I’m playing an eroge right now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just come with me!”[%p]
I dragged Daru outside the room, leaving a very confused Mayuri behind.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wow, it’s cold.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, are you trying to kill me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just be quiet and help me out for a minute. I want to check some things.”[%p]
He must’ve sensed that I was serious, because after a moment’s surprise, he nodded silently.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is Kagari missing her memories right now?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s right. I’ve said that a bunch of times.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Including her memories of the future, before she got on the time machine?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yes! All she remembers is what’s happened lately.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If she remembered the future, we could at least tell Mayushii who she really was.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re telling me that Mayuri doesn’t know Kagari is her daughter, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Già.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You decided to keep it a secret.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which means the only people who know that Kagari is from the future are...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Me, you, and Suzuha.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that all?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s all. Unless you told someone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ho capito.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry. I must not really be awake yet. I had a dream I’m mixing up with reality.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t worry about it. I live in a dream 24 hours a day, baby.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And anyway, it felt like forever since I’ve seen you so excited about something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Instead of answering, I took a second to think.[%p]
It seemed like there were three main differences with Kagari in this linea di universo.[%p]
One: she didn’t have Kurisu’s memories.[%p]
Two: she didn’t have her own memories of her childhood.[%p]
Three: only me, Daru, and Suzuha knew who Kagari really was. In other words, Mayuri didn’t know that Kagari was her daughter.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](...Am I back?)[%p]
This Kagari seemed closer to the one I’d met before I’d jumped to the linea di universo Alfa.[%p]
Everything seemed mostly the same as before, including the fact that we were trying to get back her memories.[%p]
Did this mean that a second linea di universo change had sent me back to the old one?[%p]
If I had the divergence meter, I could tell, but...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Heh.”[%p]
I was starting to think like I used to.[%p]
I chuckled at myself.[%p]
I should stop.[%p]
I’d decided to have nothing to do with the time machine or the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
All I could do was help Kagari get her memories back.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, you’ve been acting kind of weird for a bit, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’m fine. Don’t worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I hope so.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, it’s really cold. Can I go back in?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, I’m cold, too.”[%p]
Daru and I raced back inside the room.[%p]
When I got back, I could just barely make out Mayuri’s voice.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“C’è solo una cosa che sto cercando...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“la risata delle stelle,”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Scintillando nel vento,”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“la puoi afferrare se solo allunghi la mano.”[%p]
Mayuri hadn’t noticed us come back in. She was putting her textbooks into her bag, and it sounded like she was also singing a song.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What song is that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
It was only then that she realized I was there.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, welcome back. It’s cold outside. What were you guys talking about?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We were just talking about this season’s anime.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, wow!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, what was that song?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, was I singing it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“C’è solo una cosa che sto cercando...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“la risata delle stelle,”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Scintillando nel vento,”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“la puoi afferrare se solo allunghi la mano.”[%p]
I heard something fall near the front entrance.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...?!”[%p]
At some point, Kagari had opened the front door. She was standing there with a shocked expression, her mouth opening and closing.[%p]
Her bag was lying at her feet. She must’ve dropped it in surprise when she came in.[%p]
But did anything that surprising happen?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, Kagari-san! Tutturu♪!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Th-Tha...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tha?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That song...!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I recognize it!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Th-That song is...”[%p]
Kagari was trying to point at Mayuri, but shaking too much to do it.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That... song...”[%p]
She fell to the floor, like a puppet with its strings cut.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari!”[%p]
