[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean, ‘There you are’? I’ve been here the whole time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yup. Yesterday, and the day before. I’ve been here a long time.”[%p]
It did seem that way, come to think of it.[%p]
My head seemed like it was full of fuzz.[%p]
But I wasn’t sleepy, or tired, or anything like that.[%p]
My mind was very awake.[%p]
But something was missing—something important.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, where are Daru and Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you really ok? Did something happen to you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Che cosa vuoi dire?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hashida and Mayuri are right there. Look.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Tutturu♪!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How could you miss somebody as big as me, Okarin?”[%p]
Oh, that’s right.[%p]
Daru and Mayuri were always here, weren’t they?[%p]
No, it wasn’t just them.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma, you doing ok, nya? I’ll use my kitty charms to make you feel better, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kyouma-san, if there’s anything I can do to make you feel better, just tell me.”[%p]
Faris and Lukako, too.[%p]
E—[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll make you a special juice from the edible grasses I found in this area, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m here too... Okabe-kun...”[%p]
Suzuha and Moeka.[%p]
All of the Lab Mems were in the lab, like they always were.[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
This was my daily life.[%p]
This was how I spent every day.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... It appears everyone has arrived.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Therefore, we shall now begin the 65,536th Round Table! Are you ready?!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re always so loud.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you need to wipe that self-satisfied expression right off your face, assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I keep telling you. I am not your assistant!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin and Chris-chan are always such good friends.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re the perfect couple. Now go explode.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait, Hashida. I am not in a relationship with this guy!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“They say the closer you are, the more you fight, nya.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m jealous...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You should join in the fun, Urushibara Luka.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What? I couldn’t! I just couldn’t...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Fun...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop wasting time, guys! We’re starting the meeting!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So, what are we talking about today?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What else? Our topic for today is—”[%p]
What...?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our topic...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe?”[%p]
Something was wrong.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin?”[%p]
Everything seemed the same, but...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Qualcosa non va, Okarin?”[%p]
That’s right. It was cold.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma?”[%p]
I didn’t feel it.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kyouma-san...”[%p]
No emotions.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
No warmth.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabe...kun...”[%p]
Everyone was here.[%p]
But it was cold and dark... cold...[%p]
Cold—[%p]
Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold.[%p]
It was so cold it felt like the marrow of my bones was going to freeze.[%p]
Like my bones were made of ice.[%p]
Like all the blood in my body had been replaced with mercury.[%p]
It was cold.[%p]
It felt like I was going to freeze at any moment.[%p]
What was this?[%p]
Where was this place?[%p]
Where... was I?[%p]
Io—[%p]
