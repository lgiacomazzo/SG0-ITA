[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s this...?”[%p]
I asked Kiryu Moeka, as I took the papers she offered me silently.[%p]
She’d contacted Daru just ten minutes ago and told him she was on her way to the lab.[%p]
And she’d arrived right at the time she said she would.[%p]
She must’ve been very close when she’d contacted him.[%p]
What was she going to do if no one was here?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Report.”[%p]
Evidently, it was a report about her investigation thus far.[%p]
The stack of papers was shaking a little in my hands.[%p]
I still felt some unease when Moeka was in my presence.[%p]
Maybe it was just because of the anxiety meds I’d taken right after she’d said she was coming, but I was still doing a lot better than yesterday.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, Uncle?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I guess it really isn’t going to be that easy to find her...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I see...”[%p]
She must’ve been expecting something, at least a little.[%p]
There was an obvious tone of disappointment in her voice.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kagari... where are you, and what are you doing?”[%p]
With no way to answer her, I just silently flipped through the pages of the report.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s up, Okarin? Find something useful?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, not really. But...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Let me see.”[%p]
I handed the report over to Suzuha without complaint.[%p]
I pointed to the part that interested me with my finger.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“My investigation has revealed one interesting fact.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Over the past one to two months, it seems another party besides ourselves has been searching for Shiina Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Just what you read.”[%p]
Which meant—[%p]
My phone started ringing before I could finish the thought.[%p]
The caller was—Hiyajo Maho.[%p]
This was an important discussion.[%p]
I’d just have to call her back in five minutes.[%p]
She’d forgive me for that much, I was sure.[%p]
I was more interested in this other person who was looking for Kagari.[%p]
Who were they?[%p]
Had they met her?[%p]
If they knew about what she was up to now, would it be worth talking to them?[%p]
...Maho was still calling. Was it something really important?[%p]
Normally I’d just ignore her and call back later, but—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, can I take this?”[%p]
For some reason, I had to answer.[%p]
That’s what it felt like.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hello?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Hello? Okabe-san? It’s me! Hiyajo!”[%p]
She sounded on the verge of panic, and my voice naturally rose to match hers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong, Hiyajo—”[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m right next to your lab—”[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
Immediately afterward, I heard what sounded like a struggle, and then something hitting something else.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san?! Hiyajo-san?! What’s wrong?”[%p]
And then there was only silence.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin? What’s wrong?”[%p]
From the tone of her voice, it was obvious something bad had happened.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Someone’s attacking this girl I know!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, seriously? Which girl?”[%p]
But I didn’t stay to answer his question. I grabbed the nearest thing that could serve as a weapon and ran out of the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
She said she was close to the lab.[%p]
If she was coming from the station, and had chosen a route that not many people would go down, she was probably—[%p]
The alley directly in front of the lab.[%p]
I saw someone there.[%p]
They were tall and slender, and I could see a tiny silhouette struggling behind them.[%p]
That was...![%p]
I knew it. The only girl I knew that size was Maho![%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Stop it! Let me go!”[%p]
Someone had grabbed her and she was trying desperately to escape![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san!”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]???[line]“—?!”[%p]
The person who was holding her turned in surprise at my voice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line](...A woman?)[%p]
It was only then that I realized it was a woman, and that she wasn’t Japanese.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Okabe...san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, let go of Hiyajo-san!”[%p]
[name]Suspicious woman[line]“...”[%p]
Did she not understand me?[%p]
No, but she should’ve been able to guess what I was getting at.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let her go...”[%p]
I tried to strike a threatening pose with the weapon in my hand.[%p]
I finally realized that what I’d brought was the Cyalume Saber. Still, it would serve as a bluff.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll say it again. Let her—”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s not like that, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
It wasn’t?[%p]
It wasn’t like what?[%p]
[name]Suspicious woman[line]“Oh!”[%p]
The woman let go of Maho and smiled. She walked toward me with her arms open wide.[%p]
[name]Suspicious woman[line]“Are you Maho’s boyfriend?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?! What? Wait—”[%p]
Before I could ask what was going on, she’d wrapped her hands around my back—[%p]
and given me a firm hug.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I told you, he is not!”[%p]
I had no idea what the hell was going on, but the two soft objects pressed into my chest kept me from moving.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then you know her, Hiyajo-san?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I’m sorry. It was my mistake—”[%p]
[name]Woman[line]“I’m Judy. Judy Reyes. Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Okabe.”[%p]
The woman named Judy Reyes offered me her hand, her broad smile like the sun itself.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um... uh... Nice to meet you...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Heheh. Japanese will do just fine.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“What? You speak Japanese, Professor?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Yes, actually.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I had no idea. But why?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“When a girl gets to be my age, a lot happens.”[%p]
Her mischievous wink looked pretty good on her.[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Anyway, I’ll introduce myself properly. Judy. Judy Reyes. Nice to meet you.”[%p]
I returned her handshake.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“O-Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Professor Reyes says she came to Japan for an AI conference.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’s a professor? At Viktor Chondria?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I research psychophysiology.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Psycho...?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s the intersection of psychology and biology. In other words, she researches how the activities of the brain affect the inner workings and diseases of the mind.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“In that sense, her research is a lot more useful to humanity than ours.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“That’s not true. Depending on how it turns out, your Amadeus could turn into an incredibly useful piece of technology.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It makes me happy to hear you say that.”[%p]
In short, Dr. Reyes had happened to see Maho on the streets of Akihabara, and had decided to surprise her by grabbing her from behind.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Still, that’s pretty mean of you. Following me all the way from the station...”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I followed you? From the station?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s right. You followed me the whole time, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“No, I didn’t. I happened to see you from that shop over there, and decided to surprise you.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Maho had only just relaxed when Dr. Reyes’ answer drained her face of its color.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hiyajo-san, someone followed you?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yes... that’s what it felt like.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you see anyone suspicious?”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“...”[%p]
Dr. Reyes denied it with that unique shrug that foreigners always do.[%p]
I looked back over the alley, but of course, I didn’t see anyone.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I must have been mistaken, then.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“I’m sure you were. Japan’s the safest country in the world, right?”[%p]
Was it?[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“What are you going to do now, Maho?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I...”[%p]
Reyes seemed to sense something in Maho’s silence.[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Heh, I see. All right, I’ll be on my way, then. We should talk some time, Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Reyes[line]“Bye!”[%p]
She gave me a meaningful wink as she left.[%p]
The station was in the opposite direction. Should I have said something?[%p]
I got a strange sense that she was feeling me out, but it seemed like a waste of time to resist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So this is Hiyajo-san. You remember me telling you about how I met her at the seminar, right?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sorry for all the fuss.”[%p]
I ended up taking Maho back to the lab, where everyone was waiting for my return.[%p]
Suzuha had actually gone out once to look for me, but evidently by that time I was already gone.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, I’m glad it was nothing.”[%p]
After I gave an introduction and an explanation, everyone let out a sigh of relief.[%p]
Maho seemed to want to ask a lot of questions about the lab, but I had something I had to finish first.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry... Where were we?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We were talking about another group looking for Kagari-tan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, that’s right!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That... is that true, Kiryu-san?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“It’s true...”[%p]
I looked back down at Moeka’s report, where she’d written all the details.[%p]
She’d even hired a private investigator to check it out.[%p]
Which meant that it was probably true.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no chance it was Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I thought of that, but...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Some of the people looking for her were men... Some were even foreigners.”[%p]
Foreigners?[%p]
Why would they be looking for Kagari?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m the only one with any connection to Kagari in this time. So why would anyone—”[%p]
Could it be SERN?![%p]
Maybe SERN realized that she was from the future and had gone looking for her?[%p]
But if that was the case, then Moeka would have to know about it...[%p]
No, the Rounders were all given their orders individually, so it would make sense if she didn’t know what the others were up to.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shiina Kagari’s been here for 12 years. She has to have met some people during that time.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“More like she couldn’t survive that long without somebody’s help.”[%p]
That’s true.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words, what this report tells us is...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Someone who knows who Shiina Kagari is has started looking for her recently, for some unknown reason.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That means that at least until recently, she was alive.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, that’s right!”[%p]
Unless they could travel through time like Suzuha, if they were looking for her, that meant they’d known where she was until she disappeared.[%p]
If people had started looking for her in the last few months, that meant she’d been alive until then.[%p]
There was nothing else to be learned from Moeka’s report.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“What should we do...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Could you continue the investigation...?”[%p]
If people were looking for Kagari in Akihabara, that meant she might still be here.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...All right.”[%p]
Moeka took her payment for the work she’d done so far, and left the lab.[%p]
Daru had paid the bill.[%p]
It seemed that when his future daughter was at stake, he was willing to spend money.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“You’re looking for someone?”[%p]
Maho had been looking around the lab with interest.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, just a girl I know.”[%p]
It worried me that some of the people looking for Shiina Kagari weren’t Japanese.[%p]
Even outside of SERN, there were people all over the world who would jump at the chance to learn more about the time machine.[%p]
If they somehow learned that Kagari was from the future, that could mean she was caught up in some kind of trouble...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“All right, Okarin. Hiyajo-shi. [color index="280AA02D1400"]Deets plz[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve already told you everything there is to know, though.”[%p]
She was Dr. Leskinen’s assistant, and both she and the professor had been very good to me. I was helping with their work a little. I’d told him all this before.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“For example, is there going to be some complete [color index="280AA02D1400"]stravolgimento di trama[color index="800000"] where she suddenly becomes a lab member?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Probably not.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Then can I at least call her Maho-tan? Actually, I’m just gonna.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Maho-tan...?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Did I get your name wrong?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That’s not it! It’s just a weird thing to say.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But you’re Maho-tan, right, Maho-tan? Don’t you agree, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t ask me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Just stop calling me that.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But I refuse!”[%p]
He never changes, does he?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So anyway, Hiyajo-san, what brings you to the lab today? Did I tell you about this place?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Amadeus told me.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“There was... something I wanted to talk to you about, but forget it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I got to see this mysterious laboratory, and it looks like you’re all busy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Was she... mad?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yeah, she was really ticked off. She says you’re not picking up her calls.”[%p]
...That’s exactly what I expected, yeah.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? What? What? What are we talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing involving romance. Cool it, man.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Is this really bothering you after all, Okabe-san? If you want to stop being a tester, you can...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not it. It’s just...”[%p]
I hated how I was starting to feel dependent on her.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Talk to her some time, if you ever feel like it. She’s lonely.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Okay...”[%p]
The word “lonely” made my heart ache a little.[%p]
But even so, I still didn’t talk to [Kurisu] that day.[%p]
