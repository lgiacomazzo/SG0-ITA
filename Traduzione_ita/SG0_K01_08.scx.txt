[name]Kagari[line]To tell the truth, I had known it was coming.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“I wonder why Mamma wanted me to come here...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Maybe she’s thinking of a surprise?”[%p]
Kagari whispered as if she wanted it to be true.[%p]
Today was July 7th. Tanabata.[%p]
The lab was going to have a Tanabata party with the Tennouji family on the roof of the building.[%p]
It was essentially an excuse to hold a barbecue.[%p]
The sky was clear that day, so the night stars were sure to be pretty.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“I have to get back and keep getting ready. With Mamma’s help, of course.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I knew it was coming.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I knew what this meant.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I knew, but I pretended I didn’t.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I didn’t want to come here.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I didn’t want to see this. I wanted to look away.[%e]
I took one step after another toward the roof.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I need to hurry.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma’s waiting.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why now...?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
When I opened the door, I was met with a burst of warm wind and the gentle summer twilight.[%p]
The stars could already be seen twinkling in the evening sky.[%p]
[linebreak][margin top="38"]Mayuri was there.[%p]
She was standing right next to the time machine.[%p]
She had one hand on her head to keep the wind from blowing away her hat, and another reached out toward the sky.[%e]
Her open hand stretched straight up toward the Akihabara sky,[%p]
as if she was trying to grab the brightest star.[%p]
Her eyes seemed to look past the stars toward something beyond.[%p]
It was so pretty,[%p]
so ephemeral,[%p]
and so fragile.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma...”[%p]
Kagari couldn’t stop herself from crying out.[%p]
It felt like if she didn’t stop her, the stars would take her mother away.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, Kagari-chan! Tutturu♪!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma...”[%p]
The tension started to drain from Kagari’s body.[%p]
[linebreak][margin top="38"]—Good. Mamma was acting normal now.[%p]
[linebreak][margin top="38"]There was nothing to worry about. Mamma would never leave her. Ever.[%p]
When Kagari ran over, Mayuri lowered the hand that she’d reached out toward the sky.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“What’s wrong? Why did you want me to come here?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri smiled, slightly embarrassed, and spun the other way.[%p]
And then she looked up at the time machine.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“This is what you came here in, isn’t it, Kagari-chan?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why bring that up? It’s not something I—”[%p]
Her words caught in her throat.[%p]
She realized that the time machine’s hatch was open.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why...?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why is the time machine’s hatch open?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
And then someone appeared from within the time machine.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kagari?!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why are you...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s what I want to know! What are you two doing?!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Big Sis Mayu... You promised you’d keep it a secret from Kagari.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you, Suzu-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wanted to say goodbye to Kagari-chan, no matter what.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ll be done soon, so keep getting ready.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Ok. Once you’re done, get in.”[%p]
Suzuha disappeared back inside the time machine.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“A secret? Goodbye? Getting ready?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What are you two talking about?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I don’t understand!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I did understand.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I’d known exactly what was coming since I got the message from Mamma.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]But I didn’t want to accept it.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]I didn’t want to accept that the time machine was going to tear me away from Mamma again.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Listen, Mayushii’s about to go back into the past with Suzu-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So that the person she loves can wake up.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...It’s impossible.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“The le linee di universo are going to converge.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No matter how hard you try, you can’t change them.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No one can!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii can’t change them.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Then...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know Okarin can.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin has the power to change the future.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And even Mayushii can go back to that day, and give him a little push.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That day is our only chance.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It won’t work!”[%p]
Kagari grabbed Mayuri’s arms.[%p]
But she just smiled, sadly.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Even if it doesn’t...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wants to see him again.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hououin Kyouma... I want to see my Hikoboshi again.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]But I knew this was coming.[%e]
Ever since the day she got her memories back,[%p]
Kagari’s life had been truly happy.[%p]
She’d lived every day in a peaceful Japan, with no war, and with Mayuri and the rest of the lab.[%p]
Every day shined like a jewel. And she’d thought it would last forever.[%p]
[linebreak][margin top="38"]Però...[%e]
She’d known what that look in Mayuri’s eyes had meant.[%p]
She’d known why even when everyone was having fun, Mayuri always seemed kind of sad.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“What about me...?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What happens to me?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“If Uncle Okarin does reach Steins Gate...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Maybe the war won’t happen.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“And maybe a lot of people will be saved.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“But then... Then I won’t be able to meet you!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s not true.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No matter what the future holds, I’m going to meet you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“In that world, you might not be alone.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You might have a happy life with your real mom and dad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But even if you do, I’ll still come see you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And then we can be really, really, really good friends!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So you don’t need to worry about a thing.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You and I might forget about each other!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“How can you come find me if you don’t remember me?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“It’s impossible!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nope. Mayushii will know who you are.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“How?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“How can you be sure?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Because...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Because that’s fate.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The bond between Mayushii and Kagari-chan won’t be broken by anything.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So even if we lose our memories, Mayushii will come find you.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma...”[%p]
Tears like pearls fell from Mayuri’s eyes, but she kept smiling at Kagari anyway.[%p]
And for the first time, Kagari realized[%p]
how strong Mayuri Shiina really was.[%p]
She realized, even if Mayuri didn’t, how tough and strong her will was.[%p]
This girl, who seemed so small and fragile,[%p]
believed in the power of the future more than anyone in the world.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok, I’m going to go.”[%p]
Mayuri was about to get in the time machine.[%p]
She could see Mayuri’s legs shaking with each step up the ladder she took.[%p]
[linebreak][margin top="38"]—She couldn’t let this happen.[%p]
[linebreak][margin top="38"]It would just end up like that day in 2036.[%p]
Kagari couldn’t take that anymore.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Wait!”[%p]
Kagari clung to Mayuri’s body.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I won’t let you go to the past!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’ll go instead!”[%p]
Kagari grabbed the phone that Mayuri was holding, and then pulled down on her hard.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kyah?!”[%p]
Mayuri lost her balance and fell off the ladder,[%p]
and Kagari leapt inside.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kagari, are you crazy?!”[%p]
Kagari ignored her and leaned out of the hatch to smile down at Mayuri.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’ll take care of Uncle Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“So just wait there!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Big Sis Suzuha, close the hatch.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ne sei sicura?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sì.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...All right.”[%p]
The hatch started to close.[%p]
Mayuri was staring up at Kagari in shock.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kagari-chan...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Mamma! I’ll always love you!”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“In the past, in the present, and in the future!”[%p]
And then the hatch closed.[%p]
She couldn’t see her beloved mother anymore.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“...”[%p]
She wiped away the tears, sat down in the passenger seat, and strapped herself in.[%p]
Suzuha sat in the main seat and grinned.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I didn’t think I’d be doing this with you twice.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“We’ve just gone back to the first time, is all.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This is nothing like the first time. You were sobbing like a baby then.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“You were crying a little, too, Big Sis Suzuha.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Andiamo, Kagari... Nel passato.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ok.”[%p]
Suzuha tapped at the console and the whole seat started to shake.[%p]
At the same time, a pale light began to shine from within the machine. The time travel was beginning.[%e]
There was no guarantee it would work.[%p]
She might never see Mayuri again.[%p]
But she swore that she would make this succeed,[%p]
as the daughter of Shiina Mayuri.[%e]
[name]Kagari[line]“There’s just one thing I’m searching for...”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“the laughter of the stars,”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“twinkling in the wind,”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“you can grab it if you just reach out your hand.”[%p]
No matter how far apart they were,[%p]
that song would connect them together.[%e]
