Circa la metà dei posti a sedere al Go Go Curry erano occupati.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Era domenica, ma erano anche passate le 14, e quindi l'ora di punta del pranzo era terminata.[%e]
Suzuha era seduta in fondo al ristorante, con un berretto da baseball abbassato sul viso.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Si nascondeva il viso con il berretto, e osservava attentamente una coppia seduta lì vicino.[%e]
[name]Dipendente GO GO CURRY[line]“Ecco a voi. Il vostro [color index="280AA02D1400"]Major Curry[color index="800000"].”[%p]
Un allegro dipendente mise davanti a loro due giganteschi piatti d'argento—o vassoi, per essere precisi.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha poteva vedere gli altri clienti guardarli e bisbigliare tra loro.[%e]
Dopotutto, la coppia si distingueva davvero dal resto.[%p]
[margin top="38"]L'uomo era un gigante che sembrava che mangiasse sempre Major Curry, ma la donna era magra, carina e sembrava molto gentile.[%p]
[margin top="38"]La combinazione di un uomo enorme e di una donna snella era squilibrata come la combinazione di una bella ragazza e del Major Curry.[%e]
Il Major Curry era grande. Anzi enorme.[%p]
Suzuha ne era consapevole per esperienza diretta.[%e]
Gli enormi vassoi d'argento erano carichi di riso e curry, e completati da due cotolette fritte, gamberi fritti, salsiccia, un uovo sodo e una montagna di cavoli.[%p]
[margin top="38"]La quantità di curry era due o tre volte superiore a quella che si trova in un piatto normale, e il condimento era altrettanto grande.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Anche un giovane ragazzo che sta crescendo avrebbe difficoltà a mangiare tutto.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha era irritata.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](Perché hai ordinato il Major Curry al tuo primo appuntamento con lei, Papà?)[%p]
La coppia in stile “La bella e la bestia” che Suzuha stava osservando, naturalmente, era formata da Itaru e Yuki.[%p]
[margin top="38"]La mattina erano andati a vedere un film a Yurakucho, poi sono venuti ad Akihabara... e sono andati direttamente al Go Go Curry.[%e]
Suzuha li aveva seguiti per tutto il tempo.[%p]
Ecco perché non riusciva a credere ai luoghi scelti da Itaru per l'appuntamento.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](Non mi preoccupa affatto il Go Go Curry... Anzi, mi piace, però...)[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line](Questo è il vostro primo appuntamento! Ci sono altri posti dove sareste potuti andare.)[%p]
Strinse forte il cucchiaio e strinse i denti.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha non sapeva quasi nulla della cultura giovanile del Giappone nel 2011, e persino lei sapeva che fosse una cattiva idea. Chi poteva sapere cosa passasse per la testa di Yuki—o almeno così pensava Suzuha.[%p]
Però...[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Wow, è ancora meglio di come appare nelle foto!”[%p]
Sorprendentemente, Yuki stava ignorando le persone intorno a lei, e si godeva innocentemente l'enorme quantità di curry.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um... uh... Amane-shi, se non puoi mangiarlo tutto, lo finisco io per te, ok?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Ok, grazie. Ma in realtà sono abbastanza brava in queste cose.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“D-Davvero? Questa sì che è una sorpresa.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Heheheh... In realtà venivo sempre qui e guardavo il menu all'esterno. Ho sempre voluto provarlo.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Sono contenta che tu mi abbia portato qui.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“M-Mi fa piacere sentirlo.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?”[%p]
Suzuha evidentemente si stava preoccupando per niente, ma comunque si rese conto che Itaru si stava comportando in modo strano.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Da quando era uscito dal cinema, camminava e parlava in modo strano. Invece della sua solita postura ingobbita, si stava sforzando per stare dritto con la schiena.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Ogni suo movimento sembrava stranamente forzato, come se fosse un robot rotto.[%p]
[margin top="38"]E aveva bevuto un bicchiere dopo l'altro di acqua.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Oh, scusami. Posso avere anch'io dell'altra acqua?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Eh? Oh, certo. Certo.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Grazie.”[%p]
Itaru versò l'acqua nel bicchiere di Yuki.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha aveva un brutto presentimento.[%p]
[margin top="38"]E aveva ragione. Itaru si mosse così goffamente che le rovesciò un po' d'acqua sulla mano.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Kyah...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“S-S-S-S-S-Stai bene?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Ehm... la mia mano si è bagnata un po'. Ad ogni modo, mangiamo prima che si raffreddi, ok?”[%p]
Yuki pulì velocemente il tavolo con il suo fazzoletto, e prese la forchetta e il cucchiaio. Nei suoi occhi c'erano delle stelle.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Ok, mangiamo.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“M-Mangiamo.”[%p]
Yuki sembrava godersi davvero il suo pasto, ma Itaru era molto formale e silenzioso.[%p]
Lui stava dando dei piccoli morsi a un pezzo di cotoletta fritta, come uno scoiattolo che mangia una noce.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Per tutto il tempo, non hanno detto neanche una parola.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](Cosa stai facendo, Papà? La mamma non vorrà più averti intorno se ti comporti così!)[%p]
Aveva deciso di inviargli un messaggio su RINE per dirgli di darsi una regolata, e aveva appena tirato fuori il suo telefono quando—[%e]
[name]Dipendente GO GO CURRY[line]“Here’s your Major Curry, with extra roux!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?!”[%p]
A huge plate was laid on the table in front of her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The other customers started murmuring again.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Come to think of it, when she’d followed them into the store, she’d ordered her usual—Major Curry with extra roux—and then forgotten about it.[%e]
Now everybody was going to focus on her![%p]
In a small shop like this, it was suicide.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uh...”[%p]
Just as she expected, her eyes met Yuki’s.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Suzuha-san! I didn’t realize you were here!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, um...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah, what a coincidence seeing you here, Yuki-san, Brother...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You should’ve said something.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, I didn’t even notice you. Really.”[%p]
She realized that she should probably leave, but she couldn’t go without at least taking a bite of the Major Curry in front of her.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Her experiences in the war had left her completely unable to waste food.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She felt Yuki and Itaru staring at her as she reluctantly picked up her spoon.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, yeah. You two enjoy yourselves.”[%p]
Her only choice was to finish her extra-large curry as soon as possible. She couldn’t let herself be in the way![%p]
[margin top="38"]But instead, Yuki came over and picked up Suzuha’s plate.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh...?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Um, excuse me. Can my friend sit with us?”[%p]
[name]Dipendente GO GO CURRY[line]“Sure, go ahead.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“He says it’s ok. Let’s all eat together!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait, wait, wait. Why?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Why? Because you ordered Major Curry, too. I think we need to have a race.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh?!”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hashida-san can be the judge.”[%p]
And before Suzuha could respond, Yuki had moved her plate over to their table.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, wait!”[%p]
She had no choice but to follow, but before she sat down, she whispered in Yuki’s ear.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re on a date, right?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? Oh, yeah. I’m on a date.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“It makes me blush when I say it aloud. Heheh...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Itaru didn’t react at all...[%p]
Even though she was sure he’d overheard that.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um, I’ve never been on a date, so I don’t know how they work, but...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is it normal to have a curry speed-eating contest with another girl in the middle of a date?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hmm... I don’t really know.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But you see it a lot in anime and manga, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“A little sister who doesn’t want to lose her big brother runs up to the girlfriend and says, ‘Let’s have a competition!’”[%p]
For some reason, Yuki seemed incredibly enthused.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha was overwhelmed by her energy.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I-I don’t know anything about that...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is that how it works, Brother?”[%p]
But even when she turned to Itaru for help, he just awkwardly sat there, eating his curry like a robot.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Brother?”[%p]
He awkwardly turned his head to face her. The rest of him stayed completely still.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Did you say something?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What’s wrong? You’re acting weird.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I am not acting weird. I am not acting weird at all.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“???”[%p]
Suzuha glanced back at Yuki.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
And for the first time, Yuki looked concerned.[%e]
In the end, Yuki and Suzuha did have their curry-eating contest, and surprisingly, both of them completely finished their meals.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha won by a very small margin, but the battle was exciting enough that not only the other customers, but the staff as well, were applauding at the end.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But the whole time Itaru kept eating by himself.[%e]
Since this wasn’t even a conversation, let alone a date, she sent Itaru home alone.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Part of her wanted to demand Itaru explain himself right now... but she decided to talk to Yuki instead.[%e]
She’d tried her best to avoid Yuki so far, in order to keep her identity a secret, but it was July now.[%p]
She would be gone from this era very soon.[%p]
[margin top="38"]This might be her last chance to talk to Yuki at all.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Whew...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I’m so glad you were there.”[%p]
Yuki sighed a little after Itaru left.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Maybe I did something to offend him...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Hashida-san doesn’t seem to enjoy being around me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You don’t think... he was just nervous?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But he was having fun talking with me before the movie, you know?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“But after the movie, he started acting really strange...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Did I do something wrong?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I asked him to take me to the curry place... but since he was acting like that the whole time, I wasn’t really sure what to do.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“And so since you happened to be there, I turned to you for help...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
What had happened inside the theater?[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha hadn’t followed them inside.[%p]
She’d spent about two hours killing time outside.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why do you like my brother?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Huh? HUH?!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I mean, maybe I shouldn’t say this, but he’s not exactly a ladykiller.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“What do you think about your brother?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Me?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Do you like him? Hate him?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“You like him, right? I can tell by watching you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well... sure.”[%p]
There were parts of him that she didn’t like.[%p]
[margin top="38"]But of course, she loved her dad.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait, why are we talking about me?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“Heheh...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So? What about you?”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“I... still don’t really know if I like him or not.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I... I see.”[%p]
Not only had Itaru not told Yuki he liked her, this was still their first date. And they hadn’t spoken that much before, either.[%p]
[margin top="38"]She hadn’t even reached the point where she saw him as a member of the opposite sex.[%e]
For almost a year, Suzuha had stayed with him, and she, Mayuri, and Faris had done everything they could to get the two of them together. But there hadn’t been any real progress.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha felt uneasy when she thought about the future.[%e]
Maybe her dad wouldn’t be her dad anymore.[%p]
Maybe her mom wouldn’t be her mom anymore.[%p]
Dad and Mom wouldn’t be together...[%p]
[margin top="38"]She imagined that future.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line](I don’t want that...)[%p]
She looked straight into Yuki’s eyes.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m going to be leaving soon.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m moving someplace far away.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“R-Really?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t think I’ll be back.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And I’m worried about Dad—I mean, my brother.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So, Yuki-san...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I know this is a weird thing for me to ask—”[%p]
And then she bowed deeply.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Please take care of Hashida Itaru.”[%p]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...?”[%p]
There was no answer from Yuki.[%e]
Suzuha looked up, afraid, and tried to gauge the expression on her face.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“...”[%p]
She looked kind of lonely.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And kind of sad.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Io non so cosa voglio fare...”[%p]
Yuki whispered, and then Suzuha—[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, jeez! What are we going to do? Everything’s almost finished! Even though it’s never even started!”[%p]
—As soon she got back to the lab, she yelled at her useless father.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Waah, Suzuha! I’m sorry! The Hashida family is doomed!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Stop sitting there feeling sorry for yourself! This isn’t funny!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Start by explaining why you were acting that way today!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You looked so excited when you left this morning. And Mom said you were normal until halfway through the movie!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“È così...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So what the hell happened?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, you see... listen to this!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know how movie theater seats are cramped, right? So I tried to sit as far to the edge as I could so I wouldn’t get in Amane-shi’s way.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And then I heard this crack, and the seat almost broke.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Cosa?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And then I tried to support myself, so I grabbed the armrest—”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“B-But... But...! It wasn’t the armrest, it was Amane-shi’s um... hand...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Mom didn’t say anything about that...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m telling the truth. It was so soft, it couldn’t have been an armrest. It was a girl’s hand! It had to have been!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I-I see...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But you see, I’ve held a lot of 2D girls’ hands, but never a real girl’s...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And? What happened then?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Amane-shi’s so nice. I guess she didn’t try to shake it off because she didn’t want to hurt me.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But you know how fat I am, right? I sweat a lot! She must have gotten soaked! But she didn’t say a word...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And so I really started to think about that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, I see. That’s why you were acting so weird.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m sure in her mind Amane-shi was going, ‘Get off me, you creepy loser pervert!’”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Mom’s not like that.”[%p]
In fact, from the way she was acting, she probably thought she’d upset him somehow.[%p]
[margin top="38"]The problem was what she’d said.[%e]
[name]Yuki[line]“Io non so cosa voglio fare...”[%p]
What did she mean by that?[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know what Mom’s thinking...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Suzuha, let’s give up on Mom and you can live with me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re not making any sense! How am I even supposed to be born?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uuuhh... But it’s impossible!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“How come you’re not even trying? Even if things look bad, you have to keep going!”[%p]
She grabbed her father by the collar and shook him.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you don’t—”[%p]
She remembered how sad Yuki had looked when they’d said goodbye.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Otherwise, something awful will happen.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sì...”[%p]
And then she heard a car park in front of the lab.[%e]
[name]Faris[line]“We’re here, nya!”[%p]
She recognized the voice coming from below the open window.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh? Is that Faris-tan’s voice?”[%p]
Suzuha let go of Itaru’s collar and moved over to the window. Below, she saw a group of people she knew.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Okabe Rintaro. Shiina Mayuri. Faris NyanNyan.[%p]
[margin top="38"]And Hiyajo Maho, too.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hiyajo-san’s here already?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But why’s she here with Uncle Okarin?”[%p]
And then she gave a start and turned back toward the room.[%e]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait, this is bad! We haven’t put it away!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Suzuha pointed toward the desk in the area di sviluppo, where the “Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio) Unit-02” was sitting.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh! Crap! Crap! Hide it!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
If nothing else, this meant that Hiyajo Maho was coming to the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici.[%p]
[margin top="38"]Suzuha hoped that this meant the work on the Microonde Telefonico (Nome Provvisorio) would get back on track.[%e]
