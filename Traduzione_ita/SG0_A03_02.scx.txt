[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Color gradually returned to my blacked-out vision.[%p]
The lab started to come back into focus.[%p]
I could tell immediately that the linea di universo had changed.[%p]
I could still see Kurisu when I closed my eyes.[%p]
But she wasn’t in the development room anymore.[%p]
It was like the whole thing had been a daydream.[%p]
I felt like I’d been caught in the boundary between dreaming and wakefulness.[%p]
Ero tornato indietro.[%p]
Back to a world without Kurisu—[%p]
This wasn’t the linea di universo Alfa.[%p]
There was no point in even bothering to check.[%p]
A moment ago, only Kurisu and I had been in this room.[%p]
And now everyone was here.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, what’s wrong? Are you sick?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’m fine.”[%p]
Mayuri...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Want some medicine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine. No need to worry.”[%p]
Lukako...[%p]
E—[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Really? You shouldn’t push yourself.”[%p]
Shiina Kagari.[%p]
If Mayuri and Kagari were here, that meant I was back to the linea di universo Beta.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m just a little hungry. I haven’t eaten anything all day.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ahaha. Come on, Okarin-san. You need to eat, or you won’t get big like Uncle Daru.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d rather skip a meal than end up like him.”[%p]
...Huh?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok, Mayushii will make something, then.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Y-You will, Mamma? Can you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aw, Kagari-chan. Not you, too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yuki-san’s been teaching me things lately.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ok, then, I’ll help, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Huh? S-Sorry. Should I not help?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not it. That’s not it at all.”[%p]
I looked around at everyone, and then back at Kagari.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari-san.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Aw, Okarin-san. I said you could just call me Kagari.”[%p]
Something was different.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ok, Kagari. Can I ask what you were calling Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm? I called her ‘Mamma.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Perché?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Why? Because she’s my mamma. Right, Mamma?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! It’s kind of embarrassing to hear that.”[%p]
I felt vaguely dizzy watching Mayuri fidget in embarrassment.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then the two of you know that you’re mother and daughter in the future?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? You’re the one who told me about her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I did?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right. You said it would better to know the truth. Right?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Sì!”[%p]
Did I really tell them?[%p]
Did I tell them something so important?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then does Lukako also...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to listen in, but I heard it anyway.”[%p]
Lukako lowered his head in apology.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, but don’t worry. I haven’t told anyone. And...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Being able to share in everyone’s secrets kind of made me happy.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I would’ve been happier if you’d told me directly, but...”[%p]
Even Lukako knew about Mayuri and Kagari.[%p]
Which meant that, of course—[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Still, I was really surprised. I thought that the time machine was only fiction. I had no idea you could make it real.”[%p]
He knew about the time machine.[%p]
Evidently, I hadn’t simply come straight back from the linea di universo Alfa.[%p]
I was in a linea di universo slightly different from the one I’d been in before—[%p]
The divergence meter I’d used before was gone now.[%p]
That meant I didn’t have a precise number, but this all felt very different.[%p]
The problem was finding out what was the same as the old linea di universo, and what was different...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari, can I ask some more questions?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“What is it?”[%p]
I showered Kagari with questions in an effort to find out what was going on.[%p]
Here’s what I learned:[%p]
First, Kagari retained her memories of her childhood—in other words, of the year 2036.[%p]
She knew Mayuri, Daru, Suzuha, and also Faris and Lukako.[%p]
But as for what the world of 2036 was like...[%p]
And how she’d become Mayuri’s daughter...[%p]
She hadn’t told them the details about that.[%p]
Fortunately, they hadn’t seemed interested in knowing about their futures.[%p]
Everyone always thinks they’d want to know what their future holds.[%p]
But when the chance finally comes, fear outweighs your curiosity.[%p]
The future wasn’t always a happy thing.[%p]
Knowing the future might destroy your dreams.[%p]
It might be a death sentence, like it was for me.[%p]
Some people would lose all sense of meaning in their lives if they knew there was inevitably going to be a war in which five billion people died.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then it was definitely your staying at Lukako’s that brought you here, right?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Yup. And it was you who brought me and Mom together, Okarin-san. Don’t you remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right... I just thought I’d double check, you know.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Double check, huh? You’re acting weird, Okarin-san.”[%p]
Kagari going missing had happened almost exactly as I remembered it.[%p]
The same was true of how she came to us.[%p]
E—[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t remember anything about what you were doing while you were missing?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Nope. Not a thing. The first thing I can remember is lying on a bed in a temple.”[%p]
She was still missing some of her memories, too.[%p]
In other words, in this linea di universo, the only memories she had were of her childhood and of the last few weeks since she’d woken up in the Chiba mountains.[%p]
The most important part was still missing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Was there anything else I needed to ask?[%p]
I was staring at the floor, trying to think, when I realized that something was missing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The floor is clean...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, I cleaned it before you came.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not it. Wasn’t there a little hole in the floor?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A hole in the floor?”[%p]
The lab had been attacked just last night.[%p]
During the attack, one of their bullets had left a dark hole in the floor.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Was there a hole there? I don’t think so...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, um... how was yesterday?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The party? It was a lot of fun.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“I’ve never had so much fun in my life!”[%p]
They wouldn’t say that if there had been an attack.[%p]
Which meant that the attack had never taken place.[%p]
Was no one after Kagari in this world?[%p]
...No, it was too early to assume that.[%p]
I still didn’t know what had happened when she’d gone missing.[%p]
Until I did, I couldn’t say for sure if she was safe.[%p]
Just like how sometimes Mayuri’s death would occur on different days in the linea di universo Alfa, the same thing might happen a few days later.[%p]
In fact, it would be better to be cautious.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I hope we can all have another party again soon.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“When we do, I’ll make something.”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Me too! I’ll help!”[%p]
They all started happily talking about last night’s party.[%p]
At first glance, it was a peaceful scene.[%p]
But something sinister might be happening, and I just didn’t know it.[%p]
No, I knew something had to be happening.[%p]
The fact that the linea di universo was changing was proof.[%p]
Why had it changed, anyway?[%p]
I thought back to the events of that night.[%p]
First, someone had taken over Amadeus.[%p]
[Kurisu] had called me and asked for help.[%p]
The linea di universo had changed right after I’d answered.[%p]
Which meant that the key was—[%p]
—Amadeus?[%p]
Did Amadeus have something to do with the linea di universo change?[%p]
And what about the group who’d attacked Kagari?[%p]
Was it all connected?[%p]
Maybe I needed to find out.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“By the way, Kagari-chan. Are you ok on time?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Oh no! Break time’s over! The owner is going to get mad at me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The owner? Do you have a job?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“That’s right. I’m working at the Braun Workshop downstairs... Wait, I already told you this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ho capito.”[%p]
In the old linea di universo, Kagari had started working for Tennouji after the attack.[%p]
That was another difference.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Jeez, you’re so out of it today, Okarin-san. Get a hold of yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Scusa.”[%p]
Kagari hopped up and skipped out of the room.[%p]
Her words and mannerisms were much more childish than they’d been in the last linea di universo.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Work hard, ’kay?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Ok! Bye!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kagari, let me ask one more thing before you go.”[%p]
I asked one final question to Kagari, who was now giving a crisp salute.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does the word ‘Amadeus’ mean anything to you?”[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Amadeus?”[%p]
Kagari seemed to think for a moment.[%p]
[name]Kagari[line]“Hmm. Nope, nothing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ho capito.”[%p]
She didn’t look like she was lying or being sarcastic. She must really not have known.[%p]
I watched her leave the lab, then took out my phone.[%p]
There was another thing I needed to check.[%p]
What was happening with Amadeus?[%p]
I looked for the icon on my screen.[%p]
Amadeus...[%p]
The AI that held Makise Kurisu’s personality and memories.[%p]
And the application which started the program.[%p]
But the program was—gone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry to call you out here.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s fine. I just happened to be nearby.”[%p]
After seeing the icon missing on my phone, I’d contacted Maho immediately.[%p]
My goal, of course, was to see what was going on with Amadeus in this world.[%p]
I had to find out.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“So what did you want to talk about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s about Amadeus...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“...What?!”[%p]
Maho’s eyes suddenly went wide.[%p]
Her reaction surprised me as well.[%p]
I’d simply said the word “Amadeus.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“How do you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Che cosa vuoi dire?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“How do you know about Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“That program was put on hold last summer, after Kurisu’s death!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Amadeus was put on hold?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You mean the project itself was shut down?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Sì, è così.”[%p]
She clenched her fists in anger.[%p]
It seemed the change in this linea di universo was a big one.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Now, answer my question. How did you know about Amadeus?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because—”[%p]
Should I tell her about the le linee di universo and teoria dei campi attrattori?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Kurisu told me that someone at her lab was doing work on it.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Kurisu told you about that?”[%p]
I decided that it wasn’t the time to tell her.[%p]
If I tried to explain everything, I’d have to tell her about D-Mail and the time machine.[%p]
Maho didn’t seem to know about all that yet.[%p]
I could imagine what she’d do if she heard the truth.[%p]
She was yet another of those people who were entranced by the possibilities of science.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you tell me a little more about how the project was shut down? What was the reason?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Evidently, there was a complaint from an outside group.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Creating an intelligenza artificiale with human memories is no different than making a copy of a human, they say. It’s something that only God is allowed to do.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“A lot of people in Europe and America like to push their own values on others. Especially in delicate matters like these.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that the only reason?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Yup. At least, as far as I’ve heard. The professor and the rest of the team were really mad when they heard the research was being shut down.”[%p]
The Amadeus program was stopped.[%p]
Did that have something to do with the linea di universo change, too?[%p]
Hmm? Wait.[%p]
So how did I meet Maho?[%p]
We’d originally met at the Amadeus seminar.[%p]
If that never happened...[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Qualcosa non va?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, I was just remembering how we met...”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, yeah. That was quite the coincidence, wasn’t it?”[%p]
I asked a few more questions, taking care not to rouse her suspicions, and managed to learn the basic story.[%p]
Maho had really wanted to see the place where Kurisu had died.[%p]
When she finally went to Radi-Kan, she’d run into me.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I hate to say this, because it sounds so unscientific, but I’d like to think that it was karma, and that Kurisu brought the two of us together.”[%p]
Karma—or perhaps another example of campo attrattore convergence.[%p]
It had already been decided that Maho and I would meet here in Akihabara.[%p]
But was there some meaning in that?[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Oh, right. Tell Mayuri-san and the others I said hi, and that last night was a lot of fun.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-Sure...”[%p]
Evidently she’d gone to last night’s party in this linea di universo, too.[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“It’s given me some good memories of Japan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good memories? You’re leaving?”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“Not immediately. Remember what I said? I’m taking over Kurisu’s research.”[%p]
[name]Maho[line]“I can’t stay on vacation in Japan forever.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Capisco.”[%p]
But still, she was only in Japan for another ten days.[%p]
I hoped nothing would happen during that time.[%p]
Amadeus had been shut down and no longer existed.[%p]
No longer would I hear Kurisu’s voice.[%p]
After I said goodbye to Maho, what that meant really started to sink in.[%p]
I could still feel Kurisu’s warmth in my chest.[%p]
Her smell...[%p]
All the feelings I’d tried to forget were coming back, now that I’d seen her.[%p]
—No one will ever be happy in that linea di universo.[%p]
—Everyone will be miserable.[%p]
That’s what she had said.[%p]
Ne ero consapevole.[%p]
That’s why I’d decided to stay here.[%p]
But that didn’t mean I could erase the sense of loss I felt.[%p]
I went back to the lab to get all this together in my head.[%p]
The cause of the attack in the last linea di universo was Kagari.[%p]
And there was a good chance that Amadeus was involved in the linea di universo change that took place afterward.[%p]
But in this linea di universo, the lab had never been attacked.[%p]
And the Amadeus project had been canceled while it was still in the research stage.[%p]
That meant that two major factors in the events that had occurred so far no longer existed.[%p]
If they were gone, maybe there was no need to worry too much.[%p]
Ma anche se fosse così...[%p]
There was still a tiny alarm going off in the back of my mind.[%p]
Why had Amadeus been shut down?[%p]
What happened to Kagari’s missing memories?[%p]
If nothing else, I might need to learn the answers to those two questions.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I thought for a while, then took out my phone and booted up the RINE application.[%p]
